<h1>...not a gitolite problem!</h1>

<p>Subtitle: Unix, ssh, git, and gitolite -- recognising the boundaries</p>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Most of this is technical, but some of it is definitely
subjective opinion.</p>

<p>More and more people are being tasked with creating a "server" environment for
git, (and thus being forcibly introduced to gitolite), before they've had a
chance to know git (or even Unix) well enough.  As a result, I often get
questions that have <strong>nothing</strong> to do with gitolite, because people don't know
where the boundaries are.</p>

<p>Here're some facts about gitolite:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>gitolite runs on the server.  To the client it looks just like any other
ssh-based URL that is using public keys.</p></li>
<li><p>once you connect, it looks just like any other <a href="http://sitaramc.github.com/concepts/0-terminology.html#working_tree_repository_bare_repository">bare repo</a> on a
server for normal git operations (clone, fetch, push).  Users won't even
<em>know</em> it exists if they do only what they're allowed to.  (I.e., it
becomes visible only when it has to deny access for some operation)</p></li>
<li><p>even "on disk", except for reserving the <code>update</code> hook for its own
purposes and possibly a couple of extra files, the contents of a
gitolite-managed bare repo are the same as a normal bare repo.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A good short term measure is to read this <a href="http://sitaramc.github.com/1-basic-usage/simple-git-session.html">simple git session</a> for
insights into the relationship between the "server" and the "client" in git.
That might help with some of the problems described in this document.</p>

<p><a name="nagp_ssh_"></a></p>

<h2>ssh</h2>

<p>Let's get this out of the way first.  The <em>superstar</em> of the "not a gitolite
problem" category is actually ssh.</p>

<p>Surprised?  It is so common that it has <a href="auth.html" title="authentication versus authorisation">its own document</a> to tell
you why it is <em>not</em> a gitolite problem, while <a href="sts.html" title="ssh troubleshooting">another one</a> tries to
help you anyway!</p>

<p><a name="nagp_PATH_issues_"></a></p>

<h2>PATH issues</h2>

<p>This is actually related to ssh.  When you run commands over ssh, they run
<em>non</em>-interactively, and depend on what your shell is, etc., certain shell
startup files are not executed, so some environment variables may be different
than what you see when you log in interactively.</p>

<p>Example: Redmine/Chiliproject using RVM and redmine git hosting can't run
post-receive hook.
<a href="https://github.com/ericpaulbishop/redmine_git_hosting/issues/125">This</a> has
more info on this specific issue.</p>

<p>It is also useful to remember that <em>gitolite does not fiddle with the PATH
except for adding the <code>GIT_PATH</code> variable if you defined it</em>.</p>

<p><a name="nagp_git_"></a></p>

<h2>git</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>first push to a new repo</p>

<p>Even if the error message said "the remote end hung up unexpectedly", this
is not a gitolite problem.  If you read the full message, it will probably
be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>No refs in common and none specified; doing nothing.
Perhaps you should specify a branch such as 'master'.
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
error: failed to push some refs to '/tmp/tmp-repos/bare.git'
</code></pre>

<p>(To be fair, this message is still not clear enough; even a careful reader
might end up trying <code>git push master</code> instead of <code>git push origin
master</code>.)</p></li>
<li><p>client-side versus server-side hooks</p>

<p>Just because you saw something in gitolite's docs about hooks, it doesn't
mean gitolite can make a "post-checkout" hook work!</p>

<p>You need to read man githooks again to understand the difference between
hooks that run on your local repo in response to local commands (like
commit, checkout), and remote hooks that run on the server in response to
a client-initiated operation (like push).</p>

<p>An equally wrong expectation is that a clone or a pull will also bring
along hooks from the server!  Sorry, but there is nothing in git that
allows the <em>server</em> to do something on the <em>client</em> -- if there were, it
would be a huge security issue.</p>

<p>What you can do in gitolite is to write yourself a hook that checks every
commit in a push for compliance and rejects the push (<em>all</em> the commits in
the push, mind!) if it doesn't comply.  However, other than telling you
how to get your hook to trigger, the actual code in that hook is out of
scope for me.</p></li>
<li><p>Jenkins integration</p>

<p>I don't know much about CI systems, but I'm pretty sure they run off of
some hook or other, but gitolite may already be using those hooks.  The
section on hook chaining <a href="hooks.html#hookchaining" title="hook chaining">here</a> shows you how to run your own
hooks.</p>

<p>In short, CI integration is no more a gitolite problem than any other
purpose for which git's hooks can be used.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="nagp_windows_"></a></p>

<h2>windows</h2>

<p>I'm <em>interested</em> in making sure it works fine with Windows, simply because I
have colleagues at work who use it.  But that doesn't mean I can help you; I
just don't know enough to help you.  (And if you even breathe the words
"putty" or "plink" I will totally tune you out!)</p>

<p>I do have people using it happily on Windows with Eclipse, Visual Studio, and
God alone knows what else, so I know it <em>can</em> (be made to) work.</p>

<p>So, hang in there... it'll all work out eventually.</p>

<p><a name="nagp_apple_"></a></p>

<h2>apple</h2>

<p>Weirdly enough, this is the one thing that Steve Ballmer and I probably agree
on, so I won't elaborate on that ;-)</p>

<p>It seems to me though, that many recent reports of "weird" behaviour reported
have come from Macs.  Yet another reason for me to back off with an apology.</p>

<p><a name="nagp_just_say_NO__"></a></p>

<h2>just say NO!</h2>

<p>These are the things I won't do, for various reasons, mostly technical, with a
smattering of some subjective stuff.  If you've been hit by one of these, and
disagree with me -- well that's why gitolite is GPL.  As long as you satisfy
the GPL, you can simply "fork off" ;-)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>using a database backend</p>

<p>Someone wanted help rewriting gitolite to use a database instead of a perl
hash.</p>

<p>I think that's a very bad idea.  Show me an install where gitolite does
not scale and I'll fix it without using a damn database.  I <em>chose</em> the
perl hash very deliberately and for very specific reasons; using a DB
would kill all that.</p></li>
<li><p>symlinks within <code>REPO_BASE</code></p>

<p>Someone wanted to put the actual repos somewhere else and create a symlink
to them inside gitolite's <code>REPO_BASE</code>.</p>

<p>No.  Gitolite assumes all of <code>REPO_BASE</code> is in its control, and nothing
else outside is (barring the admin directory <code>~/.gitolite</code> and the rc file
<code>~/.gitolite.rc</code>).</p>

<p>You could argue that this is secure enough if the admin knows what he is
doing, but I'm not buying that.  Some odd screwup involving symlinks will
show up some day and gitolite will get blamed.</p></li>
<li><p>deleting environment variables copied from client session</p>

<p>This same guy wanted me to add code to delete certain environment
variables at startup because "the openssh servers in the linux
distribution that [he] use[s], are configured to copy <code>GIT_*</code> variables to
the remote session".</p>

<p>This is wrong on so many levels it's almost plonk-able!</p></li>
<li><p>using <code>cp</code> instead of <code>ln</code></p>

<p>Guy has an NTFS file system mounted on Linux.  So... no symlinks (an NTFS
file system on Windows works fine because msysgit/cygwin manage to
<em>simulate</em> them.  NTFS mounted on Linux won't do that!)</p>

<p>He wanted all the symlink stuff to be replaced by copies.</p>

<p>No. Way.</p></li>
<li><p>non-bare repos on the server</p>

<p>Some guy gave me a complicated spiel about git-svn not liking bare repos
or whatever.  I tuned off at the first mention of those 3 letters so I
don't really know what the actual problem was.</p>

<p>But it doesn't matter.  Even if someone (Ralf H) had not chipped in with a
workable solution, I still would not do it.  A server repo should be bare.
Period.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="nagp_behind_my_back_"></a></p>

<h3>behind my back</h3>

<p>Some of the "Just say NO" items are from situations where someone or something
changes stuff behind gitolite's back.  I am particularly unsympathetic to this
sort of thing.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>incomplete ownership of <code>REPO_BASE</code></p>

<p>This guy had a repo-base directory where not all of the files were owned
by the git user.  As a result, some of the hooks did not get created.  He
claimed my code should detect OS-permissions issues while it's doing its
stuff.</p>

<p>No.  I refuse to have the code constantly look over its shoulder making
sure fundamental assumptions are being met.</p></li>
<li><p>empty template directory</p>

<p>(See man git-init for what a template directory is).</p>

<p>The same guy with the symlinks and the environment variables (so this is
his third appearance in this list!) had an empty template directory
because he "does not like to have sample hooks in every repository".  So
naturally, the hooks directory does not get created when you run a <code>git
init</code>.  He expects gitolite to compensate for it.</p>

<p>Granted, it's only a 1-line change.  But again, this falls under
"constantly looking over your shoulder to double check fundamental
assumptions".  Where does it end?</p></li>
<li><p>per-repo umask setting</p>

<p>Some people believe that gitolite should have code to compensate for a
"potential" failure of gitweb or httpd to restrict access as designed.</p>

<p>Sorry.  Not in "core" at least.  This is yet another of those "constantly
looking over your shoulder" examples.  Why should it be gitolite's problem
to compensate if gitweb or httpd misbehave?  Yes, I know all about layers
of security and defense in depth, thank you but no.</p>

<p><font color="gray"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I gave them a solution that involves adding <code>config
  core.sharedRepository = 0750</code> in the gitolite.conf file for those
  repos, then doing a one-time fixup for newly created repos.  But they
  decided they needed to patch gitolite and they're going with it.</p>

<p>I'm not too worried.  These guys ran a HEAVILY patched gitosis for
  years; they're probably used to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></font></p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="nagp_that_s_outrageous_"></a></p>

<h2>that's outrageous</h2>

<p>This section is for really outrageous stuff.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>clearing out a repo the long/wrong way</p>

<p>This guy tells me he often needs to clear out a repo.  How?  He first
manually deletes the repo on the server, then pushes a dummy commit to the
admin repo to let gitolite re-create it.</p>

<p>Of course, this second step is "annoying" so he mailed me and told me
there has to be a better way!</p>

<p>I asked him why he didn't try <code>git push -f</code> and he said he didn't know he
could do that.  I'm NOT joking.  I wish I were!  (Yes, we all know that
<code>git push -f</code> is not the same as delete/re-create, but the point is that
he really didn't need it; he just assumed that's the only way to force his
commits to the remote.)</p></li>
<li><p>can connect to github, can't connect to gitolite</p>

<p>So this mac-fan went on about his great IDE (CodeX or something) and how
it works with github but no luck with gitolite.  Therefore he comes and
asks on #gitolite.  (I give him bonus points for telling people on TWO
channels that it is "THE best ide").</p>

<p>The actual error?  "host unreachable".</p>

<p>In usenet terms... <code>*PLONK*</code>!</p></li>
</ul>
