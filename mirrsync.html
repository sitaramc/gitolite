<h3>commands to (re-)sync mirrors</h3>

<p>You don't have to put all the slaves in <code>gitolite.mirror.slaves</code>.  For
example, let's say you have some repos that are very active, and two of your
mirrors that are halfway across the world are getting pushed very frequently.
But you don't need those mirrors to be that closely updated, perhaps <em>because</em>
they are halfway across the world and those guys are asleep ;-)</p>

<p>Or maybe there was a network glitch and even the default slaves are now
lagging, so they need to be manually synced.</p>

<p>Or a slave realised that one of its repos is lagging for some reason, and
wants to request an immediate update.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, you need ways to sync a repo from a command line.  Here
are ways to do that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>On the master server, you can start a <strong>background</strong> job to mirror a repo.
The command/syntax is</p>

<pre><code>gl-mirror-shell request-push reponame [list of keys/slaves]
</code></pre>

<p>The list at the end is optional, and can be a mix of slave names or your
own gitolite mirror config keys.  (Yes, you can have any key, named
anything you like, as long as it starts with <code>gitolite.mirror.</code>).</p>

<p>If the list is not supplied, the <code>gitolite.mirror.slaves</code> key is used.</p>

<p>Keys can have values that in turn contain a list of keys/slaves.  The list
is recursively <em>expanded</em> but recursion is not <em>detected</em>.  Order is
preserved while duplicates are removed.  If you didn't get that, see the
example :-)</p>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: the <code>gitolite.mirror.slaves</code> key should have only hosts, no
keys, in it.</p>

<p>The program exits with a return value of "1" if it found no slaves in the
list passed, otherwise it fires off the background job, prints an
informative message, and exits with a return value of "0".</p>

<p>We'll take an example.  Let's say your gitolite config file has this:</p>

<pre><code>repo ip1
    config gitolite.mirror.master       =   "frodo"
    config gitolite.mirror.slaves       =   "sam merry pippin"
    config gitolite.mirror.hourly       =   "sam legolas"
    config gitolite.mirror.nightly      =   "gitolite.mirror.hourly gimli"
    config gitolite.mirror.all          =   "gitolite.mirror.nightly gitolite.mirror.hourly gitolite.mirror.slaves"
</code></pre>

<p>Then the following commands have the results described in comments:</p>

<pre><code>gl-mirror-shell request-push ip1
# which is the same as:
gl-mirror-shell request-push ip1 gitolite.mirror.slaves
# pushes to sam, merry, pippin

gl-mirror-shell request-push ip1 gollum
# pushes only to gollum.  Note that gollum is not a member of any of
# the slave lists we defined.

gl-mirror-shell request-push ip1 gitolite.mirror.slaves gollum
# pushes to sam, merry, pippin, gollum

gl-mirror-shell request-push ip1 gitolite.mirror.slaves gitolite.mirror.hourly
# pushes to sam, merry, pippin, legolas

gl-mirror-shell request-push ip1 gitolite.mirror.all
# pushes to sam, legolas, gimli, merry, pippin
</code></pre>

<p>The last two examples show recursive expansion with order-preserving
duplicate removal (hey there's now a published conference paper on
gitolite, so we have to use jargon <em>somewhere</em> or they won't accept
follow-on papers!).</p>

<p>If you do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>config gitolite.mirror.nightly      =   "gimli gitolite.mirror.nightly"
</code></pre>

<p>or this:</p>

<pre><code>config gitolite.mirror.nightly      =   "gimli gitolite.mirror.hourly"
config gitolite.mirror.hourly       =   "legolas gitolite.mirror.nightly"
</code></pre>

<p>you deserve what you get.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to start a <strong>foreground</strong> job, the syntax is <code>gl-mirror-shell
request-push ip1 -fg gollum</code>.  Foreground mode requires one (and only one)
slave name -- you cannot send to an implicit list, nor to more than one
slave.</p></li>
<li><p>Cronjobs and custom mirroring schemes are now very easy to do.  Use either
of the command forms above and write a script around it.  Appendix A
contains an example setup.</p></li>
<li><p>Once in a while a slave will realise it needs an update, and wants to ask
for one.  It can run this command to do so:</p>

<pre><code>ssh sam request-push ip2
</code></pre>

<p>If the requesting server is not one of the slaves listed in the config
variable gitolite.mirror.slaves on the master, it will be rejected.</p>

<p>This is always a foreground push, reflecting the fact that the slave may
want to know why their push errored out or didn't work last time or
whatever.</p></li>
</ol>
