<h1>assorted tips and notes</h1>

<p><a name="tips_notes_common_errors_and_mistakes_"></a></p>

<h2>common errors and mistakes</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>adding <code>repositories/</code> at the start of the repo name in the <code>git clone</code>.
This error is typically made by the <em>admin</em> himself -- because he knows
what <code>$REPO_BASE</code> is set to and thinks he has to provide that prefix on
the client side also :-)  In fact gitolite prepends <code>$REPO_BASE</code>
internally, so you shouldn't also do the same thing!</p></li>
<li><p>being able to clone but getting errors on push.  Most likely caused by a
combination of:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>you already have shell access to the server, not just "gitolite"
access, <em>and</em></p></li>
<li><p>you cloned using <code>git clone git@server:repositories/repo.git</code> (notice
there's an extra "repositories/" in there?)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, you used a key that completely bypassed gitolite and went
straight to the shell to do the clone.</p>

<p><p>Please see doc/ssh-troubleshooting.mkd for what all this means.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>other errors, warnings, notes...</h2>

<p><a name="tips_notes_cloning_an_empty_repo_"></a></p>

<h3>cloning an empty repo</h3>

<p>Cloning an empty repo is only possible with clients greater than 1.6.2.  So at
least one of your clients needs to have a recent git.  Once at least one
commit has been made, older clients can also use it</p>

<p>When you clone an empty repo, git seems to complain about <code>fatal: The remote
end hung up unexpectedly</code>.  However, you can ignore this, since it doesn't
seem to hurt anything.  [Update 2009-09-14; this has been fixed in git
1.6.4.3]</p>

<p><a name="tips_notes_all_syntax_for_repos_"></a></p>

<h3><code>@all</code> syntax for repos</h3>

<p>There <em>is</em> a way to use the <code>@all</code> syntax for repos also, as described in
<code>doc/gitolite.conf.mkd</code>.  However, there are a couple of minor cautions:</p>

<ul>
<li>don't use <code>NAME/</code> or such restrictions on the special <code>@all</code> repo.  Due to
the potential for defeating a crucial optimisation and slowing down <em>all</em>
access, we do not support this.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="tips_notes_features_"></a></p>

<h2>features</h2>

<p>Apart from the big ones listed in the top level README, and subjective ones
like "better config file format", gitolite has evolved to have many useful
features than the original goal of branch-level access control.</p>

<p><a name="tips_notes_syntax_and_normal_usage_"></a></p>

<h3>syntax and normal usage</h3>

<p><a name="multikey"></a></p>

<h4>one user, many keys</h4>

<p>If you have a user who has more than one pubkey (like from different machines)
the simplest way to deal with it is to add subdirectories and add keys there.
For example, I might have these files in <code>keydir/</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sitaram.pub
home/sitaram.pub
laptop/sitaram.pub
</code></pre>

<h3>INconvenience features</h3>

<p><a name="repodel"></a></p>

<h4>deleting a repo</h4>

<p>By design, there is no code in gitolite to <em>delete</em> a repo if the repo was
specified by name in the config file.  (Wildcard repos <em>can</em> be deleted by the
user; see <a href="wild_repodel.html" title="deleting repos safely">here</a> for details).</p>

<p>If you <em>do</em> want to permanently delete a <em>non</em>-wildcard repo, here's what you
do:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>remove the repo from the gitolite-admin repo clone's <code>conf/gitolite.conf</code>
file.  "add" the change, commit, and push.</p></li>
<li><p><em>then</em> remove the repo from <code>~/repositories</code> on the server (or whatever
you set <code>$REPO_BASE</code> to in the <code>~/.gitolite.rc</code>)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="tips_notes_renaming_a_repo_"></a></p>

<h4>renaming a repo</h4>

<p>This is similar; there's no code to do this in gitolite.  What you do is:</p>

<ul>
<li>log on to the server, <code>cd $REPO_BASE</code> (default: <code>cd ~/repositories</code>), and
<code>mv old-name.git new-name.git</code></li>
<li>back on your gitolite-admin clone, edit <code>conf/gitolite.conf</code> and replace
all occurrences of <code>old-name</code> with <code>new-name</code>.  Then add, commit, and push
as usual.</li>
</ul>

<p>The order of these 2 steps is important; do not reverse them :-)</p>

<p><a name="tips_notes_helping_with_gitweb_"></a></p>

<h3>helping with gitweb</h3>

<p>Although gitweb is a completely separate program, gitolite can do quite a
lot to help you manage gitweb access as well; once the initial setup is
complete, you can do it all from within the gitolite config file!</p>

<p>If you just want gitweb to show some repositories, see <a href="confother_.html#gwd" title="specifying gitweb and daemon access">here</a> for how to
specify which repos to show.</p>

<p><a name="gitwebauth"></a></p>

<h4>easier to link gitweb authorisation with gitolite</h4>

<p>Over and above whether a repo is even <em>shown</em> by gitweb, you may want to
further restrict people, allowing them to view <em>only</em> those repos for which
they have been given read access by gitolite.</p>

<p>This requires that:</p>

<ul>
<li>you have to have some sort of HTTP auth on your web server (out of my
scope, sorry!)</li>
<li>the HTTP auth should use the same username (like "sitaram") as used in the
gitolite config (for the corresponding user)</li>
</ul>

<p>Normally a superuser sets up passwords for users using the "htpasswd" command,
but this is an administrative chore.</p>

<p>Robin Smidsrød had the <em>great</em> idea that, since each user already has pubkey
access to <code>git@server</code>, this gives us a very neat way of using gitolite to let
the users <em>manage their own HTTP passwords</em>.  Here's how:</p>

<ul>
<li>setup apache so that the htaccess file it looks for is owned by the "git"
user</li>
<li>in the <code>~/.gitolite.rc</code> file, look for the variable <code>$HTPASSWD_FILE</code> and
point it to this file</li>
<li>tell your users to type in <code>ssh git@server htpasswd</code> to set or change
their HTTP passwords</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course some other authentication method can be used (e.g. <code>mod_ldap</code>) as
long as the usernames match.</p>

<p>Gitweb allows you to specify a subroutine to decide on access.  We use that
feature and tie it to gitolite.  Configuration example can be found in
<code>contrib/gitweb/</code>.</p>

<p><a name="umask"></a></p>

<h4>umask setting</h4>

<p>Gitweb not able to read your repos?  You can change the umask for newly
created repos to something more relaxed -- see the <code>REPO_UMASK</code> setting in the
<a href="rc.html" title="configuring gitolite's advanced features -- the `.gitolite.rc` file">rc file documentation</a>.</p>

<p><a name="tips_notes_advanced_features_"></a></p>

<h3>advanced features</h3>

<p>There are some really cool features that are now in pretty wide use.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="wild.html" title="repositories named with wildcards">repos named with wildcards</a></strong> is useful when some or most of your
repos fit a pattern, avoiding the need to name repos individually in the
config file.  New repos matching the pattern can be created by any user
(if you give them rights to), with a set of permissions assigned to
"roles", and the creator can then place users into those roles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="ADCs.html" title="admin defined commands">admin defined commands</a></strong> allow controlled access to specific
commands and scripts without giving users full shell access.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="tips_notes_odds_and_ends_"></a></p>

<h3>odds and ends</h3>

<p><a name="tips_notes_poking_the_admin_repo_to_force_a_compile_"></a></p>

<h4>"poking" the admin repo to force a compile</h4>

<p>Sometimes you need to force a compile, as if you pushed the gitolite-admin
repo.  I have a git alias that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>[alias]
    poke = !git ls-remote origin | grep -w refs/heads/poke &amp;&amp; git push origin :poke || git push origin master:poke
</code></pre>

<p>so I just run <code>git poke</code>.  This toggles between deleting and creating a dummy
branch called "poke".  Either operation will trigger the hooks.</p>
