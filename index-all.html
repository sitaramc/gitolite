<h1>Hosting git repositories</h1>

<p>Gitolite allows you to setup git hosting on a central server, with
fine-grained access control and many (many!) more powerful features.</p>

<p><a name="qi"></a></p>

<h2>quick install</h2>

<p><strong>If</strong> you're comfortable with Unix and ssh, <strong>and</strong> you have a relatively
sane setup, the following steps should work:</p>

<ul>
<li>create a user called <code>git</code>.  Login to this user.</li>
<li>copy your ssh pubkey from your workstation.  Rename it to <code>YourName.pub</code>.</li>
<li><p>now run these commands:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite
gitolite/src/gl-system-install
gl-setup -q ~/YourName.pub
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>You're done.  If it didn't work, well that's what the <a href="install.html" title="gitolite installation">install</a> doc is for,
especially the <a href="install.html#insttrouble" title="install trouble?">if you run into trouble</a> section.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: do <strong>NOT</strong> add repos or users directly on the server!  You MUST
manage the server by cloning the special 'gitolite-admin' repo on your
workstation (<code>git clone git@server:gitolite-admin</code>), making changes, and
pushing them.  Here's how to <a href="add.html" title="adding users and repos">add users and repos</a>.</p>

<h2>what is gitolite?</h2>

<p>Gitolite is an access control layer on top of git.  Here's an "executive
summary":</p>

<ul>
<li>use a single unix user ("real" user) on the server</li>
<li>provide access to many gitolite users
<ul>
<li>they are not "real" users</li>
<li>they do not get shell access</li>
</ul></li>
<li>control access to many git repositories
<ul>
<li>read access controlled at the repo level</li>
<li>write access controlled at the branch/tag/file/directory level,
including who can rewind, create, and delete branches/tags</li>
</ul></li>
<li>can be installed without root access, assuming git and perl are already
installed</li>
<li>authentication is most commonly done using sshd, but you can also use
httpd if you prefer (this may require root access).</li>
<li>several other neat features, too many to list here</li>
</ul>

<h2>why is gitolite needed?: <a href="need_.html" title="why is gitolite needed?">Link</a></h2>

<!-- file: need_ "why is gitolite needed?" -->

<h2>why is gitolite needed?</h2>

<p>Gitolite is separate from git, and needs to be installed and configured.  So...
why do we bother?</p>

<p>Gitolite is useful in any server that is going to host multiple git
repositories, each with many developers, where some sort of access control is
required.</p>

<p>In theory, this can be done with plain old Unix permissions: each user is a
member of one or more groups, each group "owns" one or more repositories, and
using unix permissions (especially the setgid bit -- <code>chmod g+s</code>) you can
allow/disallow users access to repos.</p>

<p>But there are several disadvantages here:</p>

<ul>
<li>every user needs a userid and password on the server.  This is usually a
killer, especially in tightly controlled environments</li>
<li>adding/removing access rights involves complex <code>usermod -G ...</code> mumblings
which most admins would rather not deal with</li>
<li><em>viewing</em> (aka auditing) the current set of permissions requires running
multiple commands to list directories and their permissions/ownerships,
users and their group memberships, and then correlating all these manually</li>
<li>auditing historical permissions or permission changes is pretty much
impossible without extraneous tools</li>
<li>errors or omissions in setting the permissions exactly can cause problems
of either kind: false accepts or false rejects</li>
<li>without going into ACLs it is not possible to give some people read-only
access while some others have read-write access to a repo (unless you make
it world-readable).  Group access just doesn't have enough granularity</li>
<li>it is absolutely impossible to restrict pushing by branch name or tag
name.</li>
</ul>

<p>Gitolite does away with all this:</p>

<ul>
<li>it uses ssh magic to remove the need to give actual unix userids to
developers</li>
<li>it uses a simple but powerful config file format to specify access rights</li>
<li>access control changes are affected by modifying this file, adding or
removing user's public keys, and "compiling" the configuration</li>
<li>this also makes auditing trivial -- all the data is in one place, and
changes to the configuration are also logged, so you can audit them.</li>
<li>finally, the config file allows distinguishing between read-only and
read-write access, not only at the repository level, but at the branch
level within repositories.</li>
</ul>

<!-- file: index "why did I write it?" -->

<p><a name="index_why_did_I_write_it__"></a></p>

<h2>why did I write it?</h2>

<p>The most important feature I needed was <strong>per-branch permissions</strong>.  This is
pretty much mandatory in a corporate environment, and is almost the single
reason I started <em>thinking</em> about writing gitolite.</p>

<p>It's not just "read-only" versus "read-write".  Rewinding a branch (aka "non
fast forward push") is potentially dangerous, but sometimes needed.  So is
deleting a branch (which is really just an extreme form of rewind).  I needed
something in between allowing anyone to do it (the default) and disabling it
completely (<code>receive.denyNonFastForwards</code> or <code>receive.denyDeletes</code>).</p>

<h3>some more features: <a href="morefeatures_.html" title="some more features">Link</a></h3>

<!-- file: morefeatures_ "some more features" -->

<h3>some more features</h3>

<p>Here're some more features.</p>

<ul>
<li>simple, yet powerful, config file syntax, including specifying
gitweb/daemon access.  You'll need this power if you manage lots of
users+repos+combinations of access</li>
<li>apart from branch-name based restrictions, you can also restrict by
file/dir name changed (i.e., output of <code>git diff --name-only</code>)</li>
<li>if your requirements are still too complex, you can split up the config
file and delegate authority over parts of it</li>
<li>easy to specify gitweb owner, description and gitweb/daemon access</li>
<li>easy to sync gitweb (http) authorisation with gitolite's access config</li>
<li>comprehensive logging [aka: management does not think "blame" is just a
synonym for "annotate" :-)]</li>
<li>"personal namespace" prefix for each dev</li>
<li>migration guide and simple converter for gitosis conf file</li>
<li>"exclude" (or "deny") rights at the branch/tag level</li>
<li>specify repos using patterns (patterns may include creator's name)</li>
<li>define powerful operations on the server side, even github-like forking</li>
</ul>

<!-- file: index "security" -->

<p><a name="index_security_"></a></p>

<h2>security</h2>

<p>Due to the environment in which this was created and the need it fills, I
consider this a "security" program, albeit a very modest one.</p>

<p>The first person to find a hole that allows a non-admin user to push a change
to a repository that he is not allowed to, will get a modest reward of 5000
INR.  The hole should not require enabling any of the options listed as having
a <a href="rc.html#rcsecurity" title="variables with a security impact">security impact</a> in the rc file, nor obvious things like setting
the umask too loose, etc.</p>
