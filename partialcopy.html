<h1>maintaining a partial copy of a repo</h1>

<p>The regular documentation on basic access control mentions <a href="rpr_.html" title="side note: &quot;R&quot; permissions for refs">here</a> that
it is easy to maintain two repositories if you need a (set of) branch(es) to
be "secret", with one repo that has everything, and another that has
everything but the secret branches.</p>

<p>Here's how gitolite can help do that sanely, with minimal hassles for all
concerned.  This will ensure the right branches propagate correctly when
people pull/push -- you don't have to do anything manually after setting it up
unless the rules change.</p>

<p>To start with, here's a <strong>NON-WORKING</strong> config that merely describes what
we're <strong>trying</strong> to achieve:</p>

<pre><code>                # THIS WILL NOT WORK!
repo foo
        -   secret-1$       =   wally
        RW+ dev/USER/       =   wally
        RW+                 =   dilbert alice ashok wally
</code></pre>

<p>We want Wally the slacker to not be able to see the "secret-1" branch.</p>

<p>The only way to do this is to have two repos -- one with and the other without
the secret branch.</p>

<p><font color="gray">These two repos cannot share git objects (to save disk
space) using hardlinks etc.  Doing so would cause a data leak if Wally decides
to stop slacking and start hacking.  See my conversation with Shawn
<a href="http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/git?date=2010-09-17#l2710">here</a> for more on this, but it basically involves Wally finding out
the SHA of one of the secret branches, pushing a branch that he claims to have
built on that SHA, then fetching that branch again.</p>

<p>It requires a serious understanding of the git transport protocol, how objects
are sent/received, how thin packs are created, etc., to implement it.  Or to
convince yourself that someone's implementation is correct.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the method described here, once you accept the disk space cost, is
quite understandable to mere mortals like me :-)</font></p>

<p>In the above example you had 2 sets of read access -- (1) all branches (2) all
branches except secret-1.  If you end up with one more set (say, "all branches
except secret-2") then you need one more repo to handle it.  If you can afford
the storage, the following recipe can certainly make it <em>manageable</em>.</p>

<p><a name="partial_copy_first_as_usual_the_caveats__"></a></p>

<h2>first, as usual, the caveats!</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>if you change the config to disallow something that used to be allowed,
any tags pointing to objects that Wally's repo acquired before the change,
will keep coming back!  That is, branch B1 had a tag T1 within it.  Later,
B1 was disallowed for Wally.  However, Wally's repo will still retain the
tag T1!</p>

<p>So, if you ever disallow a branch that used to be allowed, it's best to
purge Wally's repo manually and let it get rebuilt on the next access.
Just delete it from the disk, push the gitolite-admin config to force it
to re-create, then access it as a legitimate user.</p></li>
<li><p>this recipe has not been, and will not be, tested with smart http.</p></li>
<li><p>it probably won't play well with wildcard repos either; not tested.</p></li>
<li><p>finally, mirroring support for such repos has not been tested too.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="partial_copy_the_basic_idea_"></a></p>

<h2>the basic idea</h2>

<p>The basic idea is very simple.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>one repo is the "main" one.  It contains all the branches, and is the one
that people with full access will use.</p></li>
<li><p>the other repo (or all the other repos, if you have more than one set, as
described above) is a "partial copy", with only a subset of the branches
in the main repo.</p></li>
<li><p>every time someone accesses the partial copy, the branches that that user
is allowed to read are fetched from the main repo.  <strong>See note in example
below</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>every time someone pushes to the partial copy, the branch being pushed is
sent back to the main repo before the update succeeds.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The main repo is always the canonical/current one.  The others may or may not
be uptodate.</p>

<p><a name="partial_copy_the_config_file_"></a></p>

<h2>the config file</h2>

<p>Here's what we actually need to put in the config file.  Note that the
reponames can be whatever you want of course.</p>

<pre><code>repo foo
        RW+                 =   dilbert alice ashok

repo foo-partialcopy-1
        -   secret-1$       =   wally
        R                   =   wally
        RW+ dev/USER/       =   wally

        config gitolite.partialCopyOf = foo
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Important notes</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Wally must not have any access to "foo".  Absolutely none at all.</p></li>
<li><p>Wally's rules for <code>foo-partialcopy-1</code> must be written such that restricted
branches are denied.  You could list only the branches he's allowed to
read, or you could deny the ones he's not allowed and add a blanket "R"
for the others later, as in this example.</p>

<p>Note that this is the same <a href="aac.html#deny" title="&quot;deny&quot; rules">deny</a> logic that is normally used for write
operations, but applied to "read" in this case.  All we're doing is using
this logic to determine what branches from <code>foo</code> are allowed to propagate
to the partial copy repo.  <em>This is NOT being used by git to restrict
reads; at the risk of repetition, git does NOT have that capability</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>All the other users with access to <code>foo-partialcopy-1</code> must be under the
same restrictions as Wally.  So let's say Ashok is not allowed to view a
branch called "USCO".  That needs to be defined in yet another partial
copy repo, and <code>ashok</code> must be removed from the access list for <code>foo</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="partial_copy_the_hooks_"></a></p>

<h2>the hooks</h2>

<p>The code for both hooks is included in the source directory
<code>contrib/partial-copy</code>.  Note that this is all done <em>without</em> touching
gitolite core at all -- we only use two hooks; both described in the <a href="hooks.html" title="using hooks">hooks</a>
section.  A pictorial representation of all the stuff gitolite runs is
<a href="pictures.html#flow" title="gitolite flow">here</a>; it may help you understand the role that these two hooks are
playing in this scenario.</p>
