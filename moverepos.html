<h3>moving pre-existing repos into gitolite</h3>

<p>It's best to split this into different use cases.</p>

<p><strong>Case 1 -- few repos</strong>: This is for moving one or two repos at a time, when
you have a copy of the repo on your workstation.  It is also the <em>only</em> way if
you have push rights to the admin repo but no <em>shell</em> privileges on the
server.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>let gitolite create it as a brand new repo as described in the section on
"adding users and repos" at the top</p></li>
<li><p>cd to the clone on your workstation.  Make sure all the branches are
correct and no extra stuff, "temp" branches, etc., are present</p></li>
<li><p>now run these two commands</p>

<pre><code>git push --all git@server:reponame
git push --tags git@server:reponame
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>(You could also use "git push --mirror" instead of separately doing
branches and tags, but that will carry across <em>your</em> remote refs also, and
typically you may not want that.  Anyway please do a <code>git ls-remote
git@server:repo</code> to make sure all the stuff you want went through, and is
named correctly).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Case 2 -- many repos</strong>: This is when you have many existing repos to add,
and they're all bare (as good little server repos should be) and you have
shell access on the server.  Here's how to do it; please note the order is
important here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>make doubly sure they're <em>bare</em> repos ;-)</p></li>
<li><p>log on to the server and copy the repos to <code>$REPO_BASE</code> (which defaults to
<code>~/repositories</code>), making sure that the directory names end in ".git".</p></li>
<li><p>back on your workstation, add each repo (without the <code>.git</code> suffix) to
<code>conf/gitolite.conf</code> in your gitolite-admin repo clone.  Give <em>some</em> user
(even a non-existent one like "DUMMY" is fine) at least "R" access to
these repos.  Then add, commit, push.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Case 3 -- far too many repos</strong> (or your initials are JH ;-): This is when
you're like Case 2, except you have <em>so many</em> repos that step 3 becomes too
cumbersome (even with a script doing it for you).</p>

<p>Assuming you can group your repo names into various patterns, and can use
similar access control lines within each such group, you can use gitolite's
"wildcard repos" feature.</p>

<p>First read the <a href="wild.html" title="repositories named with wildcards">wildcard repositories</a> document, or at least skim
through it, to understand the basic concept.  Then do this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>do step 1 just like step 1 in Case 2 above</p></li>
<li><p>ditto for step 2</p></li>
<li><p>for each repo, determine who the owner should be and create files called
<code>gl-creater</code> (note spelling!) in each repo.  The file should contain
exactly one line with the owner name.</p></li>
<li><p>run <code>gl-setup</code> again (you don't need to supply a pub key filename)</p></li>
<li><p>finally add the repos to the conf, maybe something like this, (in this
example, the owner name was the second component of the repo path), and
add/commit/push:</p>

<pre><code>repo    pub/CREATOR/..*
        C   =   @developers
        RW+ =   CREATOR
        RW  =   WRITERS
        R   =   READERS
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Details</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>why is the order of steps different in case 1 and case 2?</p>

<p>Because in case 2, the actual data is coming from an OS 'cp' (copy)
command, not via a normal push like in case 1.  Since that happens outside
gitolite, it's easier to do it first, then tell gitolite about the repo so
it can add hooks.  (If you tell gitolite first, it will create an empty
repo as soon as you push, then your 'cp' will have to overwrite those
files, but you'll then lose gitolite's hooks, etc.  A bit more messy).</p></li>
<li><p>what's with the <code>gl-creater</code> file in case 3?</p>

<p>What the <a href="wild.html" title="repositories named with wildcards">wildcard repositories</a> document does not explain is how
ownership is <em>recorded</em> in gitolite: the <code>gl-creater</code> file contains the
owner name.  If you want to "pretend" these repos were created by some
user, you need to add that in.  That user then gets whatever access you
gave to "CREATOR" in the access rules (in our example, that was <code>RW+</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>why does case 3 need the <code>gl-setup</code> command?</p>

<p>An admin push only checks hooks on normal (non-wildcard) repos.  It would
be too timetaking otherwise.  Running <code>gl-setup</code> forces it to do this more
aggressively than an admin push, looking at wildcard repos as well as
normal ones.</p></li>
</ul>

<p></font></p>

<p>In the end, it all boils down to (a) making sure the <code>update</code> hook is correct
on all repos, wild or normal, and (b) making sure <code>gl-creater</code> contains the
owner name for wild repos.  The rest of the setup is in the conf file.</p>
