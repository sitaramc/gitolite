# - show fake "reflog" from gitolite server
# - recover deleted branches
# - recover from bad force pushes

# --------------------

# WARNING
# - heavily dependent on the gitolite log file format (duh!)
# - cannot recover if some other commits were made after the force push

# USAGE
#   ssh git@server gl-reflog show r1 refs/heads/b1
#       # shows last 10 updates to branch b1 in repo r1
#   ssh git@server gl-reflog show r1 refs/heads/b1 20
#       # shows last 20 entries...
#   ssh git@server gl-reflog recover r1 refs/heads/b1
#       # recovers the last update to b1 in r1 if it was a "+"

# NOTES
# - the verb "recover" is used because this is expected to be used most often
#   to recover deleted branches.  Plus there's enough confusion in git land
#   caused by "reset" and "revert" I thought I should add my bit to it ;-)
# - git's internal reflog is NOT recovered, even if you recover the branch.
#   I'm good but not *that* good ;-)
# - since this program produces a log entry that satisfies it's own criteria,
#   it acts as a "toggle" for its own action for rewinds (but not for deletes)
