<h3>personal branches</h3>

<p>Gitolite lets you define a "personal" or "scratch" namespace prefix for each
developer.  See <a href="tnconv_.html#pers" title="&quot;personal&quot; branches">here</a> for details.</p>

<h3>rule accumulation</h3>

<p>(Also see <a href="exaac.html#ruleaccum2" title="rule accumulation">this</a> for a different example that may be more
intuitive for some people).</p>

<p>Gitolite lets you specify access rules for a repo in bits and pieces, and
accumulates them in the same sequence they were given.  This is very
convenient.  Let's say you have a mix of open source and closed source
projects, and "bosses" should have read access to all projects, and everyone
should have read access to open source projects.  Assuming the appropriate
group definitions, this would work:</p>

<pre><code># all bosses have read access to all projects
repo @open @closed @topsecret
    R   =   @bosses

# everyone has read access to "open" projects
repo @open
    R   =   @bosses @devs @interns
</code></pre>

<p>If you notice that <code>@bosses</code> are given read access to <code>@open</code> via both rules,
don't worry that this causes some duplication or inefficiency.  It doesn't :-)</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the file, you would specify access for individual repos (like RW,
RW+, etc).  Gitolite combines all of these access rules, maintaining the
textual order in which they occur, when authorising a push.</p>

<p>And although this example used groups, you can use reponames as well, or mix
and match them.  You can even distribute rulesets across multiple "include"
files if you wish.</p>

<p>Just remember that if you use <a href="aac.html#deny" title="&quot;deny&quot; rules">deny rules</a> anywhere then the <em>order of the
rules matters</em>!</p>

<p>This feature also helps people who generate their gitolite.conf itself from
some <em>other</em> database -- it allows them much more flexibility in how they
generate rules.</p>

<h3>specifying gitweb and daemon access</h3>

<p>Gitolite allows you to specify access for git-daemon and gitweb.  This is a
feature that I personally do not use (corporate environments don't like
unauthenticated access of any kind to any repo!), but someone wanted it, so
here goes.</p>

<p>Gitolite has two pre-defined, "special", usernames: <code>daemon</code> and <code>gitweb</code>.</p>

<p>To make a repo or repo group accessible via "git daemon", just give read
permission to the special user "daemon".  Similarly, give read permission to
<code>gitweb</code> to allow the gitweb CGI to show the repo.  Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>repo    foo bar baz
    R   =   gitweb daemon
</code></pre>

<p>This gives you a quick way to offer multiple repos up for gitweb and/or daemon
access.</p>

<p>However, <strong>setting a description</strong> for the project also enables gitweb
permissions so you can do it that way if you want.  Of course in this case you
have to deal with each repo separately.  Add lines like this to gitolite.conf:</p>

<pre><code>foo = "some description"
bar = "some other description"
baz = "yet another description"
</code></pre>

<p>You can also <strong>specify an owner</strong> for gitweb to show, if you like; for example
I might use:</p>

<pre><code>gitolite "Sitaram Chamarty" = "fast, secure, fine-grained, access control for git"
</code></pre>

<p>These lines are standalone, so you can add them anywhere in the conf file.</p>

<p>Note that gitolite does <strong>not</strong> install or configure gitweb/git-daemon -- that
is a one-time setup you must do separately.  All gitolite does is:</p>

<ul>
<li>for daemon, create the file <code>git-daemon-export-ok</code> in the repository</li>
<li>for gitweb, add the repo (plus owner name, if given) to the list of
projects to be served by gitweb (see the config file variable
<code>$PROJECTS_LIST</code>, which should have the same value you specified for
<code>$projects_list</code> when setting up gitweb)</li>
<li>put the description, if given, in <code>$repo/description</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The "compile" script will keep these files consistent with the config settings
-- this includes removing such settings/files if you remove "read" permissions
for the special usernames or remove the description line.</p>

<p>Please <strong>note</strong> that giving permissions to these special users via <code>@all</code>
(that is, using either <code>repo @all</code> or <code>R = @all</code>), will not work unless you
set the rc-file variable <code>$GL_ALL_INCLUDES_SPECIAL</code> to <code>1</code>.  Also, <strong>NOTE</strong>
that giving them read access to <code>repo @all</code> means the <code>gitolite-admin</code> repo is
also accessible.  <strong>It is upto you to decide if that is OK in your
environment</strong>.</p>

<h3>repo specific <code>git config</code> commands</h3>

<p>(Thanks to teemu dot matilainen at iki dot fi)</p>

<blockquote>
  <hr />

<p><strong>Note</strong>: this won't work unless the rc file has the right settings;
  please see <code>$GL_GITCONFIG_KEYS</code> in the <a href="rc.html" title="configuring gitolite's advanced features -- the `.gitolite.rc` file">rc file doc</a> for details and
  security information.</p>

<hr />
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes you want to specify <code>git config</code> settings for your repos.</p>

<p>For example, say you have a custom post-receive hook that sends an email when
a push happens, and this hook looks in the config for whom to send the email
to, etc.</p>

<p>You can set these git config values within a "repo" paragraph:</p>

<pre><code>repo gitolite
    config hooks.mailinglist = gitolite-commits@example.tld
    config hooks.emailprefix = "[gitolite] "
    config foo.bar = ""
    config foo.baz =
</code></pre>

<p>The syntax is simple:</p>

<pre><code>config sectionname.keyname = [optional value_string]
</code></pre>

<p>This does either a plain "git config section.key value" (for the first 3
examples above) or "git config --unset-all section.key" (for the last
example).  Other forms of the <code>git config</code> command (<code>--add</code>, the
<code>value_regex</code>, etc) are not supported.</p>

<blockquote>
  <hr />

<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: simply deleting the config line from the <code>conf/gitolite.conf</code>
  file will <em>not</em> delete the variable from <code>repo.git/config</code>.  The syntax in
  the last example is the <em>only</em> way to make gitolite execute a
  <code>--unset-all</code> operation on the given key.</p>

<hr />
</blockquote>

<p>You can repeat the 'config' line as many times as you like, and the last
occurrence will be the one in effect.  This allows you to override settings
just for one project, as in this example:</p>

<pre><code>repo @all
    config gitolite.mirror.master = "frodo"
    config gitolite.mirror.slaves = "sam gollum"

repo top-secret-project
    # only sam, because we don't trust gollum
    config gitolite.mirror.slaves = "sam"
</code></pre>

<p>The "delete config variable" syntax can also be used, if you wish:</p>

<pre><code>repo highlander     # there can be only one!
    config gitolite.mirror.master =
    config gitolite.mirror.slaves =
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the general idea is to place the most generic ones (<code>repo
@all</code>, or repo patterns like <code>repo foo.*</code>) first, and place more specific ones
later to override the generic settings.</p>
