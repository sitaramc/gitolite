# paths and configuration variables for gitolite

# please read comments before editing

# this file is meant to be pulled into a perl program using "do" or "require".

# You do NOT need to know perl to edit the paths; it should be fairly
# self-explanatory and easy to maintain perl syntax :-)

# --------------------------------------

# this is where the repos go.  If you provide a relative path (not starting
# with "/"), it's relative to your $HOME.  You may want to put in something
# like "/bigdisk" or whatever if your $HOME is too small for the repos, for
# example

$REPO_BASE="repositories";

# the default umask for repositories is 0077; change this if you run stuff
# like gitweb and find it can't read the repos.  Please note the syntax;  the
# leading 0 is required

$REPO_UMASK = 0077;         # gets you 'rwx------'
# $REPO_UMASK = 0027;       # gets you 'rwxr-x---'
# $REPO_UMASK = 0022;       # gets you 'rwxr-xr-x'

# part of the setup of gitweb is a variable called $projects_list (please see
# gitweb documentation for more on this).  Set this to the same value:

$PROJECTS_LIST = $ENV{HOME} . "/projects.list";

# --------------------------------------

# I see no reason anyone may want to change the gitolite admin directory, but
# feel free to do so.  However, please note that it *must* be an *absolute*
# path (i.e., starting with a "/" character)

# gitolite admin directory, files, etc

$GL_ADMINDIR=$ENV{HOME} . "/.gitolite";

# --------------------------------------

# templates for location of the log files and format of their names

# I prefer this template (note the %y and %m placeholders)
# it produces files like `~/.gitolite/logs/gitolite-2009-09.log`

$GL_LOGT="$GL_ADMINDIR/logs/gitolite-%y-%m.log";

# other choices are below, or you can make your own -- but PLEASE MAKE SURE
# the directory exists and is writable; gitolite won't do that for you (unless
# it is the default, which is "$GL_ADMINDIR/logs")

# $GL_LOGT="$GL_ADMINDIR/logs/gitolite-%y-%m-%d.log";
# $GL_LOGT="$GL_ADMINDIR/logs/gitolite-%y.log";

# --------------------------------------

# Please DO NOT change these three paths

$GL_CONF="$GL_ADMINDIR/conf/gitolite.conf";
$GL_KEYDIR="$GL_ADMINDIR/keydir";
$GL_CONF_COMPILED="$GL_ADMINDIR/conf/gitolite.conf-compiled.pm";

# --------------------------------------

# personal branch prefix; leave it as is (empty) if you don't want to use the
# feature (see the "developer-specific branches" section in the "faq, tips,
# etc" document)

$PERSONAL="";

# uncomment one of these if you do want it.  If you change it, remember it
# MUST start with "refs/"

# I recommend this:
# $PERSONAL="refs/personal";

# if you want something more visible/noisy, use this:
# $PERSONAL="refs/heads/personal";

# NOTE: whatever value you choose, for security reasons it is better to make
# it fully qualified -- that is, starting with "refs/"

# --------------------------------------

# if git on your server is on a standard path (that is
#       ssh git@server git --version
# works), leave this setting as is.  Otherwise, choose one of the
# alternatives, or write your own

$GIT_PATH="";
# $GIT_PATH="/opt/bin/";

# --------------------------------------

# if you want to give shell access to any gitolite user(s), name them here.
# Please see doc/6-ssh-troubleshooting.mkd for details on how this works.

# Do not add people to this list indiscriminately.  AUDITABILITY OF ACCESS
# CONTROL CHANGES (AND OF REPO ACCESSES) WILL BE COMPROMISED IF ADMINS CAN
# FIDDLE WITH THE ACTUAL (PLAIN TEXT) LOG FILES THAT GITOLITE KEEPS, WHICH
# THEY CAN EASILY DO IF THEY HAVE A SHELL.

# syntax: space separated list of gitolite usernames in *one* string variable.
# $SHELL_USERS = "alice bob";

# --------------------------------------

# EXTERNAL COMMAND HELPER -- RSYNC
#
# base path of all the files that are accessible via rsync.  Must be an
# absolute path.  Leave it undefined or set to the empty string to disable the
# rsync helper.
$RSYNC_BASE = "";
# $RSYNC_BASE = "/home/git/up-down";
# $RSYNC_BASE = "/tmp/up-down";

# per perl rules, this should be the last line in such a file:
