<h3>convenience features</h3>

<p><a name="tips_notes_what_repos_do_I_have_access_to__"></a></p>

<h4>what repos do I have access to?</h4>

<p>Sometimes there are too many repos, maybe even named similarly, or with the
potential for typos, confusion about hyphens/underscores or upper/lower case,
etc.  You'd just like a simple way to know what repos you have access to.</p>

<p>Gitolite provides two commands (<a href="info_expand.html#info" title="the &quot;info&quot; command"><code>info</code></a> and <a href="info_expand.html#expand" title="the &quot;expand&quot; command"><code>expand</code></a>)
to help you find this information.</p>

<p><a name="tips_notes_support_for_git_installed_outside_default_PATH_"></a></p>

<h4>support for git installed outside default PATH</h4>

<p>The normal solution is to add to the system default PATH somehow, either by
munging <code>/etc/profile</code> or by enabling <code>PermitUserEnvironment</code> in
<code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> and then setting the PATH in <code>~/.ssh/.environment</code>.
All these are security risks because they allow a lot more than just you and
your git install :-)</p>

<p>And if you don't have root, you can't do this anyway.</p>

<p>The only solution till now has been to ask every client to set the config
parameters <code>remote.&lt;name&gt;.receivepack</code> and <code>remote.&lt;name&gt;.uploadpack</code>.  But
telling <em>every</em> client to do so is a pain...</p>

<p>Gitolite lets you specify the directory in which git binaries are to be found,
via a new variable (<code>$GIT_PATH</code>) in the "rc" file.  If this variable is
non-empty, it will be appended to the PATH environment variable before
attempting to run git stuff.</p>

<p>Very easy, very simple, and completely transparent to the users :-)</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: sometimes you have a system that already has an older "git"
installed in one of the system PATHs, but you've installed a newer git in some
non-standard location and want that picked up.  Because of security reasons,
gitolite will not prepend <code>GIT_PATH</code> to the PATH variable, so the older git
comes first and it gets kinda frustrating!</p>

<p>Here's a simple workaround.  Ignore the <code>GIT_PATH</code> variable, and directly set
the full PATH in the rc file, like so:</p>

<pre><code>$ENV{PATH} = "/home/sitaram/bin:$ENV{PATH}";
</code></pre>

<p><a name="pers"></a></p>

<h4>"personal" branches</h4>

<p>"personal" branches are great for corporate environments, where
unauthenticated pull/clone is a no-no.  Since a dev workstation cannot do
authentication, even work shared just between 2 devs has to go <em>via</em> the
server.  This causes the same branch name clutter as in a centralised VCS,
plus setting up permissions for this becomes a chore for the admin.</p>

<p>Personal branches exist <strong>in a namespace</strong> of their own.  The syntax is</p>

<pre><code>    RW+ personal/USER/  =   @userlist
</code></pre>

<p>where the "personal" can be anything you like (but cannot be empty), and the
"/USER/" part is <strong>necessary (including both slashes)</strong>.  A user "alice" (if
she's in the userlist) can then push any branches inside <code>personal/alice/</code>.
Which means she can push <code>personal/alice/foo</code> and <code>personal/alice/bar</code>, but
NOT <code>personal/alice</code>.</p>

<p>(Background: at runtime the "USER" component will be replaced by the name of
the invoking user.  Access is determined by the right hand side, as usual).</p>

<p><a name="tips_notes_custom_hooks_and_custom_git_config_"></a></p>

<h4>custom hooks and custom git config</h4>

<p>You can specify hooks that you want to propagate to all repos, as well as
per-repo "gitconfig" settings.  Please see <code>doc/2-admin.mkd</code> and
<code>doc/gitolite.conf.mkd</code> for details.</p>

<p><a name="tips_notes_bypassing_gitolite_"></a></p>

<h4>bypassing gitolite</h4>

<p>Sometimes you'll need to access one of the gitolite-managed repos directly on
the server, without going through gitolite.  Reasons may be some automatic
updates or some other ad hoc purposes you can dream up.</p>

<p>Cloning a gitolite-controlled repo is easy enough -- just use the full path
(typically <code>~/repositories/reponame.git</code>) instead of just <code>reponame</code>, to
compensate for gitolite not sitting in between and adding those things to the
repo path.</p>

<p>But when you push, the update hook (which git will invoke anyway) will fail
because it needs all sorts of access control info that it now doesn't have,
because the push was invoked without going through gitolite.</p>

<p>In order to bypass the update hook, just set the <code>GL_BYPASS_UPDATE_HOOK</code>
environment variable to "1" or something, export it, and push.  I prefer not
to set that variable permanently, preferring this mode instead:</p>

<pre><code>GL_BYPASS_UPDATE_HOOK=1 git push
</code></pre>

<p><a name="disable"></a></p>

<h4>disabling write access to take backups</h4>

<p>If you want to take normal, OS-level, backups of the system, you might want
git to be quiescent during that time, so that the backup is clean.  The best
way to do this is to disable write-access to the server for the duration of
the backup.</p>

<p>Here's how:</p>

<pre><code>cd $HOME    # if running as "git" user, else "cd ~git" or whatever
echo writes disabled during backup window &gt; .gitolite.down

# &lt;&lt; RUN YOUR BACKUP COMMAND(s) HERE &gt;&gt;

rm .gitolite.down
</code></pre>

<p>I leave it to you to</p>

<ul>
<li>make sure that if the backup script fails, the <code>.gitolite.down</code> file is
still removed (or not; maybe your policy is that if the backup failed, no
further writes are allowed.  Whatever...)</li>
<li>if you're extremely paranoid (even I wouldn't worry about this!) make sure
that no push is <em>in progress</em> by checking for any <code>git-receive-pack</code>
processes in a <code>ps</code> output.</li>
</ul>
