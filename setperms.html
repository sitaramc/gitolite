<h2>handing out rights to wildcard-matched repos</h2>

<p>In the examples above, we saw two special "user" names: READERS and WRITERS.
The permissions they have are controlled by the config file, but <strong><em>who is
part of this list</em></strong> is controlled by the person who created the repository.</p>

<p>The use case is that, although our toy example has only 3 students, in reality
there will be a few dozen, but each assignment will be worked on only by a
handful from among those.  This allows the creator to take ad hoc sets of
users from among the actual users in the system, and give them one of two
roles (in this example, READERS and WRITERS respectively).  In theory you
could do the same thing by creating lots of little "assignment-NN" groups in
the config file but that may be a little too cumbersome for non-secret
environments.</p>

<p>Create a small text file that contains the permissions you desire:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat &gt; myperms
READERS u5
WRITERS u6
(hit ctrl-d here)
</code></pre>

<p>...and use the new <strong>setperms</strong> command to set permissions for your repo:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh git@server setperms assignments/u4/a12 &lt; myperms
New perms are:
READERS u5
WRITERS u6
</code></pre>

<p>'setperms' will helpfully print what the new permissions are but you can also
use <strong>getperms</strong> to check:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh git@server getperms assignments/u4/a12
READERS u5
WRITERS u6
</code></pre>

<p>The following points are important:</p>

<ul>
<li>note the syntax of the command; it's not a "git" command, and there's no
<code>:</code> like in a repo URL.</li>
<li>for the actual text being sent in via STDIN, the first space-separated
word is the role (in this example, READERS or WRITERS), and the rest
are simple usernames.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="wildcard_repositories_admin_adding_other_roles_than_READERS_and_WRITERS_"></a></p>

<h3>(admin) adding other roles than READERS and WRITERS</h3>

<p>Let's say your needs are more complex and you need more roles.  For example,
you might like to have a setup where only a tester can update tags, and only a
manager can delete branches:</p>

<pre><code>repo foo/..*
  C                 =   u1
  RW    refs/tags/  =   TESTERS
  -     refs/tags/  =   @all
  RW+               =   WRITERS
  RW                =   INTERNS
  R                 =   READERS
  RW+D              =   MANAGERS
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, someone pre-creates the repo and assigns rights to various
people, say by sending something like this to <code>setperms</code>:</p>

<pre><code>READERS wally
WRITERS dilbert alice
MANAGERS phb
INTERNS ashok
TESTERS ashok
</code></pre>

<p>You can enable this by setting the <code>GL_WILDREPOS_PERM_CATS</code> variable in the rc
file.  The rc file documentation (<code>doc/gitolite.rc.mkd</code>) explains how.</p>

<p><a name="rolenamewarn"></a></p>

<h4><strong>IMPORTANT WARNING ABOUT THIS FEATURE</strong></h4>

<p>Please make sure that none of the role names conflict with any of the
<strong>usernames</strong> in the system.  For example, if you have a user called "foo",
make sure you do not include "foo" as a valid role in
<code>$GL_WILDREPOS_PERM_CATS</code>.</p>

<p>You can keep things sane by using UPPERCASE names for roles, while keeping all
your usernames lowercase; then you don't have to worry about this problem.</p>
