<h1>setting up gitolite</h1>

<p>Installing the software gets you ready to use it, but the first "use" of it is
always the "setup" command.</p>

<p>The first time you run it, you need to have a public key file ready.  If the
main gitolite admin's username is "alice", this file should be named
"alice.pub".  Then run</p>

<pre><code>gitolite setup -pk alice.pub
</code></pre>

<p>If that command completes without any warnings, you should be done.  If it had
a warning, you probably supplied a key which already has shell access to the
server.  That won't work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <hr />

<p>Normally, gitolite is hosted on a user that no one accesses directly --
  you log on to the server using some other userid, and then <code>su - git</code>.  In
  this scenario, there <em>is</em> no key being used for shell access, so there is
  no conflict.</p>

<p>An alternative method is to use two different keys, and a <a href="sts.html#ssh-ha">host
  alias</a> to distinguish the two.</p>

<p><a href="emergencies.html#ce">common errors</a> has some links to background information on this
  issue.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The 'setup' command has other uses, so you will be running it at other times
after the install as well:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>to setup the update hook when you move <a href="rare.html#existing">existing</a> repos to gitolite.
This also applies if someone has been fiddling with the hooks on some
repos and you want to put them all right quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>to replace a <a href="emergencies.html#lost-key">lost admin key</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When in doubt, run 'gitolite setup' anyway; it doesn't do any harm, though it
may take a minute or so if you have more than a few thousand repos!</p>
