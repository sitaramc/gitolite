<h1>migrating from gitosis to gitolite</h1>

<p>[2012-04-09] Modified for gitolite g3.  These instructions have not really
been tested with g3, but are expected to work.</p>

<p>Migrating from gitosis to gitolite is fairly easy, because the basic design is
the same.</p>

<p>There's only one thing that might trip up people: the userid.  Gitosis uses
<code>gitosis</code>.  Gitolite can use any userid you want; most of the documentation
uses <code>git</code>, while DEB/RPM packages use <code>gitolite</code>.</p>

<p>Here are the steps on the server:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(as 'gitosis' on the server) <strong>Rename</strong> <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> to
something else so that no one can accidentally push while you're doing
this.</p></li>
<li><p>(as 'gitosis' on the server) For added safety, <strong>delete</strong> the post-update
hook that gitosis-admin installed</p>

<pre><code>rm ~/repositories/gitosis-admin.git/hooks/post-update
</code></pre>

<p>or at least rename it to <code>.sample</code> like all the other hooks hanging
around, or edit it and comment out the line that calls <code>gitosis-run-hook
post-update</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>(as 'gitosis' on the server) If you already use the <code>update</code> hook for some
reason, you'll have to make that a <a href="vref.html">VREF</a>.  This is because gitolite
uses the update hook for checking write access.</p></li>
<li><p>(as 'root' on the server) copy all of <code>~/repositories</code> to the gitolite
hosting user's home directory.  Something like</p>

<pre><code>cp -a /home/gitosis/repositories /home/git
chown -R git.git /home/git/repositories
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>(as 'root' and/or 'git' on the server) Follow instructions to install
gitolite; see the <a href="install.html">install document</a>.</p>

<p>This will give you a gitolite config that has the required entries for the
"gitolite-admin" repo.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, log off the server and get back to the client.  All subsequent
instructions are to be read as "on gitolite admin's workstation".</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>clone</strong> the new gitolite-admin repo to your workstation.  (You already
have a clone of the gitosis-admin repo so now you have both).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>convert</strong> your gitosis config file and append it to your gitolite config
file.  Substitute the path for your gitosis-admin clone in <code>$GSAC</code> below,
and similarly the path for your gito<strong>lite</strong>-admin clone in <code>$GLAC</code>.  (The
convert-gitosis-conf program is a standalone program that you can bring
over from any gitolite clone; you don't have to install all of gitolite on
your workstation to use this):</p>

<pre><code>./convert-gitosis-conf &lt; $GSAC/gitosis.conf &gt;&gt; $GLAC/conf/gitolite.conf
</code></pre>

<p>Be sure to check the file to make sure it converted correctly.  Then
remove the entry for the 'gitosis-admin' repo.  You do not need it here
and it may cause confusion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>copy</strong> the keys from gitosis's keydir (same meanings for GSAC and GLAC)</p>

<pre><code>cp $GSAC/keydir/* $GLAC/keydir
</code></pre>

<p>If your gitosis-admin key was <code>you@machine.pub</code>, and you supplied the same
one to gitolite's gl-setup program as <code>you.pub</code> when you installed
gitolite, then you should remove <code>you@machine.pub</code> from the new keydir
now.  Otherwise you will have 2 pubkey files (<code>you.pub</code> and
<code>you@machine.pub</code>) which are identical, which is <em>not</em> a good idea.</p>

<p>Similarly, you should replace all occurrences of <code>you@machine.pub</code> with
<code>you</code> in the <code>conf/gitolite.conf</code> file.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: if you have any users with names like <code>user@foo</code>, where the
part after the <code>@</code> does <em>not</em> have a <code>.</code> in it (i.e., does not look like
an email address), you need to change them, because gitolite uses that
syntax for <a href="users.html#multi-key">enabling multi keys</a>.</p>

<p>You have two choices in how to fix this.  You can change the gitolite
config so that all mention of <code>user@foo</code> is changed to just <code>user</code>.</p>

<p>Or you can change each occurrence of <code>user@foo</code> to, say, <code>user_foo</code> <em>and</em>
change the pubkey filename in keydir/ also the same way (<code>user_foo.pub</code>).</p>

<p>Just to repeat, you do NOT need to do this if the username was like
<code>user@foo.bar</code>, i.e., the part after the <code>@</code> had a <code>.</code> in it, because then
it looks like an email address.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>IMPORTANT: expand any multi-key files you may have</strong>.  Gitosis is happy
to accept files containing more than one public key (one per line) and
assign all the keys to the same user.  Gitolite does not allow that; see
<a href="users.html#multi-key">here</a>'s for how gitolite handles multi-keys.</p>

<p>So if you had any multi-keys in gitosis, they need to be carefully split
into individual keys.</p>

<p>You can split the keys manually, or use the following code (just
copy-paste it into your xterm after "cd"-ing to your gitolite-admin repo
clone):</p>

<pre><code>wc -l keydir/*.pub | grep -v total | grep -v -w 1 | while read a b
do
    i=1
    cat $b|while read l
    do
        echo "$l" &gt; ${b%.pub}@$i.pub
        (( i++ ))
    done
    mv $b $b.done
done
</code></pre>

<p>This will split each multi-key file (say "sitaram.pub") into individual
files called "sitaram@1.pub", "sitaram@2.pub", etc., and rename the
original to "sitaram.pub.done" so gitolite won't pick it up.</p>

<p>At this point you can rename the split parts more appropriately, like
"sitaram@laptop.pub" and "sitaram@desktop.pub" or whatever.  <em>Please check
the files to make sure this worked properly</em></p></li>
<li><p>Check all your changes to your gitolite-admin clone, commit, and push</p></li>
</ul>
