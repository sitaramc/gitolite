<h1>notes for developers</h1>

<p>Gitolite has a huge bunch of existing features that gradually need to moved
over.  Plus you may want to write your own programs to interact with it.</p>

<p>Hints for developers wishing to help migrate features over from g2 are
[here][dev-hints].</p>

<p>Here are some random notes on developing hooks, commands, triggers, and sugar
scripts.</p>

<h2>environment variables</h2>

<p>In general, the following environment variables should always be available:</p>

<pre><code>GL_BINDIR
GL_REPO_BASE
GL_ADMIN_BASE
</code></pre>

<p>Commands invoked by a remote client will also have <code>GL_USER</code> set.  Hooks will
have <code>GL_REPO</code> also set.</p>

<h2>APIs</h2>

<h3>the shell API</h3>

<p>The following commands exist to help you write shell scripts that interact
easily with gitolite.  Each of them responds to <code>h</code> so please run that for
more info.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>gitolite access</code> to check access rights given repo, user, type of access
(R, W, ...) and refname (optional).  Example use: src/commands/desc</p></li>
<li><p><code>gitolite creator</code> to get/check the creator of a repo.  Example use:
src/commands/desc</p></li>
<li><p><code>gitolite git-config</code> to check gitolite options or git config variables
directly from gitolite's "compiled output, (i.e., without looking at the
actual <code>repo.git/config</code> file or using the <code>git config</code> command).  Example
use: none yet</p></li>
<li><p><code>gitolite query-rc</code> to check the value of an RC variable.  Example use:
src/commands/desc.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, you can also look at the comments in src/Gitolite/Easy.pm (the
perl API module) for ideas.</p>

<h3>the perl API</h3>

<p>...is implemented by Gitolite::Easy; see src/Gitolite/Easy.pm.  This is a work
in progress; for example it does not yet have the equivalent of <code>gitolite
git-config</code>.  I'll add it when I or someone else needs it.</p>

<h2>your own hooks</h2>

<h3>anything but the update hook</h3>

<p>If you want to add your own hook, it's easy as long as it's not the 'update'
hook.  Just add it to <code>$HOME/.gitolite/hooks/common</code> and run <code>gitolite setup</code>.</p>

<p>The rest is between you and 'man githooks' :-)</p>

<h3>update hook</h3>

<p>If you want to add additional <code>update</code> hook functionality, do this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>write and test your update hook separately from gitolite</p></li>
<li><p>now add the code to src/VREF.  Let's say it is called "foo".</p></li>
<li><p>to call your new update hook to all accesses for all repos, add this to
the end of your conf file:</p>

<pre><code>repo @all
    -       VREF/foo        =   @all
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>As you probably guessed, you can now make your additional update hooks more
selective, applying them only to some repos / users / combinations.</p>

<p>Note: a normal update hook expects 3 arguments (ref, old SHA, new SHA).  A
VREF will get those three, followed by at least 4 more.  Your VREF should just
ignore the extra args.</p>

<h2>your own commands</h2>

<p>You can add your own commands.  You can run them on the server (example,
<code>gitolite access</code>).  Then you can enable certain commands to be allowed to run
by a remote user by adding them to the "COMMANDS" hash of the <a href="rc.html">rc</a> file.</p>

<p>Commands are standalone programs, in any language you like.  They simply
receive the arguments you append.  In addition, the env var <code>GL_USER</code> is
available if it is being run remotely.  src/commands/desc is the best example
at present.</p>

<h2>your own trigger programs</h2>

<p>Trigger programs are just commands whose names have been added to the
appropriate list in the <a href="rc.html">rc</a> file.  Triggers get specific arguments
depending on when they are called; see <a href="triggers.html">here</a> for details.</p>

<p>You can write programs that are both manually runnable as well as callable by
trigger events, especially if they don't <em>need</em> any arguments.</p>

<p>Look in the distributed <a href="rc.html">rc</a> file for example programs; at this point there
aren't many.</p>

<h2>your own "sugar"</h2>

<p>Syntactic sugar helpers are NOT complete, standalone, programs.  They must
include a perl sub called <code>sugar_script</code> that takes in a listref, and returns
a listref.  The listrefs point to a list that contains the entire conf file
(with all <a href="misc.html#include">include</a> processing already done).  You create a new list with
contents modified as you like and return a ref to it.</p>

<p>There are a couple of examples in src/syntactic-sugar.</p>
