<h1>virtual refs</h1>

<p>Here's an example to start you off.</p>

<pre><code>repo    r1
    RW+                         =   lead_dev dev2 dev3
    -   VREF/COUNT/9            =   dev2 dev3
    -   VREF/COUNT/3/NEWFILES   =   dev2 dev3
</code></pre>

<p>Now dev2 and dev3 cannot push changes that affect more than 9 files at a time,
nor those that have more than 3 new files.</p>

<p>Another example is detecting duplicate pubkeys in a push to the admin repo:</p>

<pre><code>repo gitolite-admin
    # ... normal rules ...
    -   VREF/DUPKEYS            =   @all
</code></pre>

<hr />

<h2>rule matching recap</h2>

<p>You won't get any joy out of this if you don't understand at least
<a href="refex.html">refex</a>es and how <a href="rules.html">rules</a> are processed.</p>

<p>But VREFs have one <strong>very important difference</strong> from normal rules.  With
VREFs, a <strong>fallthru results in success</strong>.  You'll see why this is more
convenient as you read on.</p>

<hr />

<h2>what is a virtual ref</h2>

<p>A ref like <code>refs/heads/master</code> is the main property of a push that gitolite
uses to make its yes/no decision.  I call this a "real" ref.</p>

<p>Any <em>other</em> property of the push that you want to use to help in the decision
is therefore a <em>virtual</em> ref.  This could be a property that git knows about,
like in the example above, or comes from outside git like, say, the current
time; see examples section later for some ideas.</p>

<h2>fallthru is success here</h2>

<p>Notice that you didn't need to add an <code>RW+ VREF/...</code> rule for user <code>lead_dev</code>
in our example.  This section explains why.</p>

<p><strong>Virtual refs are best used as additional "deny" rules</strong>, performing extra
checks that core gitolite cannot.</p>

<p>Making fallthru be a "fail" forces you to add rules for all users, instead of
just the ones who should have those extra checks.  Worse, since every virtual
ref involves calling an external program, many of these calls may be wasted.</p>

<p>There's another advantage to doing it this way: a VREF can choose to simply
die if things look bad, and it will have the same effect, assuming you used
the VREF only in [deny][] rules.</p>

<p>This in turn means any existing update hook can be used as a VREF <em>as-is</em>, as
long as it (a) prints nothing on success and (b) dies on failure.  See the
email-check and dupkeys examples later.</p>

<h2>how it works -- overview</h2>

<p>Briefly, a refex starting with <code>VREF/FOO</code> triggers a call to a program called
<code>FOO</code> in <code>$GL_BINDIR/VREF</code>.</p>

<p>That program is expected to print zero or more lines to its STDOUT; each line
is taken by gitolite as a new "ref" to be matched against all the refexes for
this user in the config.  Including the refex that caused the vref call, of
course.</p>

<p>Normally, you send back the refex itself, if the test determines that the rule
should be matched, otherwise nothing.  So, in our example, we print
<code>VREF/COUNT/9</code> if the count was indeed greater than 9.  Otherwise we just
exit.</p>

<h2>how it works -- details</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>the VREF code is only called if there are any VREF rules for the user,
which means when the lead developer pushes, the VREF is not called at all.</p>

<p>Side note: this is enormously more efficient than adding additional
<code>update</code> hooks, which will get executed whether they are needed or not,
for every repo and every user!</p></li>
<li><p>when dev2 or dev3 push, gitolite first checks the real ref
(<code>ref/heads/master</code> or whatever).  After this it looks at VREF rules, and
calls an external program for every one it finds.  Specifically, in a line
like</p>

<pre><code>   -   VREF/COUNT/3/NEWFILES    =   user
</code></pre>

<p>COUNT is the vref name, so the program called is
<code>$GL_BINDIR/VREF/COUNT</code>.</p>

<p>The program is passed <strong>nine arguments</strong> in this case (see next section
for details).</p></li>
<li><p>the script can print anything it wants to STDOUT; the first word in each
such line will be treated as a virtual ref to be matched against all the
rules, while the rest, if any, is a message to be added to the standard
"...DENIED..." message that gitolite prints if that refex matches.</p>

<p>Usually it only makes sense to either</p>

<ul>
<li>print nothing -- if you don't want the rule that triggered it to match
(ie., whatever condition being tested was not violated; like if the
count of changed files did not exceed 9, in our earlier example)</li>
<li>print the refex itself (plus an optional message), so that it matches
the line which invoked it</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>arguments passed to the vref code</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>arguments <strong>1, 2, 3</strong>: the 'ref', 'oldsha', and 'newsha' that git passed
to the update hook (see 'man githooks')</p>

<p>This, combined with the fact that non-zero exits are detected, mean that
you can simply use an existing update.secondary as a new VREF as-is, no
changes needed.</p></li>
<li><p>arguments <strong>4 and 5</strong>: the 'oldtree' and 'newtree' SHAs.  These are the
same as the oldsha and newsha values, except if one of them is all-0.
(indicating a ref creation or deletion).  In that case the corresponding
'tree' SHA is set (by gitolite, as a courtesy) to the special SHA
<code>4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904</code>, which is the hash of an empty
tree.</p>

<p>(None of these shenanigans would have been needed if <code>git diff $oldsha
$newsha</code> would not error out when passed an all-0 SHA.)</p></li>
<li><p>argument <strong>6</strong>: the attempted access flag.  Typically <code>W</code> or <code>+</code>, but
could also be <code>C</code>, <code>D</code>, or any of these 4 followed by <code>M</code>.  If you have to
ask what they mean, you haven't read enough gitolite documentation to be
able to make virtual refs work.</p></li>
<li><p>argument <strong>7</strong>: is the entire refex; in our example
<code>VREF/COUNT/3/NEWFILES</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>arguments <strong>8 onward</strong>: are the split out (by <code>/</code>) portions of the refex,
excluding the first two components.  In our example they would be <code>3</code>
followed by <code>NEWFILES</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, argument 7 is redundant if you have 8 and 9.  It's meant to make it easy
to write vref scripts in any language.  See script examples in source.</p>

<h2>what (else) can the vref code pass back</h2>

<p>Actually, the vref code can pass anything back; each line in its output will
be matched against all the rules as usual (with the exception that fallthru is
not failure).</p>

<p>For example, you could have a ruleset like this:</p>

<pre><code>repo r1
    # ... normal rules ...

    -   VREF/TIME/WEEKEND       =   @interns
    -   VREF/TIME/WEEKNIGHT     =   @interns
    -   VREF/TIME/HOLIDAY       =   @interns
</code></pre>

<p>and you could write the TIME vref code to passback any or all
of the times that match.  Then if an intern tried to access the system, each
rule would trigger a call to gl-bindir/VREF/TIME.</p>

<p>The script should send back any of the applicable times (even more than one,
or none at all, as the case may be).  So even if it was invoked using the
first rule, it might pass back (to gitolite) a virtual ref saying
'VREF/TIME/HOLIDAY', which would promptly cause the request to be denied.</p>

<h2>VREFs shipped with gitolite</h2>

<h3>number of new files</h3>

<p>If a dev pushes more than 2 <em>new</em> files, the top commit needs to have a
signed-off by line in its commit message.  For example if he has 4 new files
this text should be:</p>

<pre><code>4 new files signed-off by: &lt;top commit author's email&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The config entry for this is below (<code>NO_SIGNOFF</code> applies only to, and thus
implies, <code>NEWFILES</code>):</p>

<pre><code> RW+ VREF/COUNT/2/NO_SIGNOFF         =   sitaram
 -   VREF/COUNT/2/NO_SIGNOFF         =   @all
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how the refex in both cases is <em>exactly</em> the same.  If you make it
different (even change the number on my access line), things won't work.</p>

<p>Junior devs can't push more than 10 new files, even with a signed-off by line:</p>

<pre><code> -   VREF/COUNT/10/NEWFILES          =   @junior_devs
</code></pre>

<h3>advanced filetype detection</h3>

<p>Note: this is more for illustration than use; it's rather specific to one of
the projects I manage but the idea is the important thing.</p>

<p>Sometimes a file has a standard extension (that cannot be 'gitignore'd), but
it is actually automatically generated.  Here's one way to catch it:</p>

<pre><code> -   VREF/FILETYPE/AUTOGENERATED     =   @all
</code></pre>

<p>You can look at <code>src/VREF/FILETYPE</code> to see how it handles the
'AUTOGENERATED' option.  You could also have a more generic option, like
perhaps BINARY, and handle that in the FILETYPE vref too.</p>

<h3>checking author email</h3>

<p>Some people want to ensure that "you can only push your own commits".</p>

<p>If you force it on everyone, this is a very silly idea (see "Philosophical
Notes" section of <code>src/VREF/EMAIL-CHECK</code>).</p>

<p>But there may be value in enforcing it just for the junior developers.</p>

<p>The neat thing is that the existing <code>contrib/update.email-check</code> was just
copied to <code>src/VREF/EMAIL-CHECK</code> and it works, because VREFs get
the same first 3 arguments and those are all that it cares about.  (Note: you
have to change one subroutine in that script if you want to use it)</p>

<h3>catching duplicate pubkeys</h3>

<p>We covered this as a teaser example at the start.</p>

<h2>other ideas -- code welcome!</h2>

<h3>"no non-merge first-parents"</h3>

<p>Shruggar on #gitolite wanted this.  Possible code to implement it would be
something like this (untested)</p>

<pre><code>[ -z "$(git rev-list --first-parent --no-merges $2..$3)" ]
</code></pre>

<p>This can be implemented using <code>src/VREF/MERGE-CHECK</code> as a model.
That script does what the 'in core' feature called [merge check][mergecheck]
does, although the syntax to be used in conf/gitolite will be quite different.</p>

<h3>other ideas for VREFs</h3>

<p>Here are some more ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>number of commits (<code>git rev-list --count $old $new</code>)</li>
<li>number of binary files in commit (currently I only know to count
occurrences of <code>Bin</code> in the output of <code>git diff --stat</code></li>
<li>number of <em>new</em> binary files (count <code>Bin 0 -&gt;</code> in <code>git diff --stat</code>
output)</li>
<li>time of day/day of week (see example snippet somewhere above)</li>
<li>IP address</li>
<li>phase of the moon</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that pretty much anything that involves <code>$oldsha..$newsha</code> will have to
deal with the issue that when you push a new tag or branch, the "old" part
is all 0's, and unless you consider <code>--all</code> existing branches and tags it
becomes meaningless in terms of "number of new files" etc.</p>
