<h1>testing gitolite</h1>

<p>Here's how to <em>run</em> the tests:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite
cd gitolite
git checkout -f g3

# if you're not ok with your ~/.ssh getting clobbered
prove

# if you're ok with your ~/.ssh getting clobbered
# prove t/*.t t/ssh*
</code></pre>

<p>Gitolite's test suite is mostly written using <a href="http://github.com/sitaramc/tsh">tsh</a> -- the "testing shell".
Take a look at some of the scripts and you will see what it looks like.  It
has a few quirks and nuances; if you really care, email me.</p>

<p>The tests also use a somewhat convoluted system of environment variables in
order to run <em>entirely</em> as a local user, without going through ssh at all.
This lets a complete test suite run in about a fifth or less of the time it
would otherwise take.</p>

<p>If you think that defeats the purpose of the testing, you haven't read
<a href="auth.html">this</a> yet.</p>

<p>There are 2 specific tests that deal with ssh though, which are run only on
request, as you can see above, because they clobber your <code>~/.ssh</code>.  You have
been warned.</p>
