<h1>WARNINGS</h1>

<p>Gitolite does NOT like it if you fiddle with files, directories, permissions,
etc., on the server except as directed in the documentation.  Gitolite also
expects all the directories and files it manages/uses to be owned by the
hosting user and not have strange permissions and ownerships.</p>

<p>Very few people have fallen foul of this, but the ones who <em>did</em> became very
obnoxious about it, hence this warning.</p>

<p>Gitolite depends on several system-installed packages: openssh, git, perl, sh
being the main ones.  They should all be configured sensibly and with most of
the normal defaults.  (For example, if your sshd config says the authorized
keys file should be placed in some directory other than the default, expect
trouble).</p>

<hr />

<p>For the entertainment of the sensible majority, and as a way of thanking all
of you, here are some examples of requests (demands in some cases) I have
received over the last couple of years.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>deleting environment variables copied from client session</p>

<p>demand: add code to delete certain environment variables at startup
because "the openssh servers in the linux distribution that [he] use[s],
are configured to copy <code>GIT_*</code> variables to the remote session".</p>

<p>This is wrong on so many levels it's almost plonk-able!</p></li>
<li><p>using <code>cp</code> instead of <code>ln</code></p>

<p>Guy has an NTFS file system mounted on Linux.  So... no symlinks (an NTFS
file system on Windows works fine because msysgit/cygwin manage to
<em>simulate</em> them.  NTFS mounted on Linux won't do that!)</p>

<p>He wanted all the symlink stuff to be replaced by copies.</p>

<p>No. Way.</p></li>
<li><p>non-bare repos on the server</p>

<p>Some guy gave me a complicated spiel about git-svn not liking bare repos
or whatever.  I tuned off at the first mention of those 3 letters so I
don't really know what the actual problem was.</p>

<p>But it doesn't matter.  Even if someone (Ralf H) had not chipped in with a
workable solution, I still would not do it.  A server repo should be bare.
Period.</p></li>
<li><p>incomplete ownership of <code>GL_REPO_BASE</code></p>

<p>This guy had a repo-base directory where not all of the files were owned
by the git user.  As a result, some of the hooks did not get created.  He
claimed my code should detect OS-permissions issues while it's doing its
stuff.</p>

<p>No.  I refuse to have the code constantly look over its shoulder making
sure fundamental assumptions are being met.</p></li>
<li><p>empty template directory</p>

<p>(See man git-init for what a template directory is).</p>

<p>The same guy with the environment variables had an empty template
directory because he "does not like to have sample hooks in every
repository".  So naturally, the hooks directory does not get created when
you run a <code>git init</code>.  He expects gitolite to compensate for it.</p>

<p>Granted, it's only a 1-line change.  But again, this falls under
"constantly looking over your shoulder to double check fundamental
assumptions".  Where does it end?</p></li>
</ul>
