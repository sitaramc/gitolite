<h1>support for gitolite</h1>

<p>Email addresses etc are in the "contact and license" section at the bottom of
the <a href="http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/">main</a> document.</p>

<p>If you're willing to read, you will only need support for the most obscure
issues.  I often don't bother responding for silly issues that are already in
the docs.  Seriously, folks, troubleshooting involves reading; do I really
need to <em>say</em> that?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lost your admin key?  Try <a href="adminpush.html" title="gl-admin-push: bypassing gitolite for the gitolite-admin repo">gl-admin-push</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>For install/setup issues see the <a href="install.html#insttrouble" title="install trouble?">install trouble?</a> section
of the <a href="install.html" title="gitolite installation">install</a> document.</p>

<p>In particular, that section has two links for ssh issues.  <strong>I've yet to
see an ssh problem that is not already covered by those</strong> (but please tell
me if you find one!)</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="index.html#rtfm" title="what to read...">suggested reading list</a> section is a quick overview of the
documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>If you still can't find what you need, try the <a href="http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/master-toc.html"><strong>master index/table of
contents</strong></a> and use
your browser's search function.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Note on the online docs</strong>: the online docs break up longer documents by
putting less "central" concepts into subdocuments (replacing the text with a
link so you know it's there).  I did this because the most frequent complaint
was "TL;DR" (your documentation is too long); I do believe it is now easier to
find things/navigate.</p>

<p><font color="gray">Of course, now someone complained that it took him "4
middle-of-text clicks" to reach some section... sigh!</font></p>
