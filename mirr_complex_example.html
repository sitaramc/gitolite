<h1>semi-autonomous mirroring setup example</h1>

<p>This document describes one way to do this.  Gitolite is powerful so you can
probably find other ways to suit you.</p>

<p><a name="mirroring_complex_example_overview_of_problem_"></a></p>

<h2>overview of problem</h2>

<p>The example is from real life, with the following characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>multiple servers (hosts)</li>
<li>multiple "products", each product has one or more git repos</li>
<li>different products are "native to" (mastered on) different hosts</li>
<li>a product may be mirrored to zero or more other hosts (mirrored to zero
hosts means it is <strong>local</strong> to the host)</li>
</ul>

<p>The admin requirements are:</p>

<ul>
<li>the overall system will have one or more <strong>master admins</strong>; they manage
the main config file, for instance.</li>
<li>each host will have one or more <strong>host admins</strong></li>
<li>these host admins should be allowed to create any repos they need (within
one of a set of directory names allocated to them), and assign access to
whomever they please</li>
<li>they should not be able to "step on each other" -- setup access rules for
repos not in their control</li>
</ul>

<p>The following can only be done by the master admins:</p>

<ul>
<li>authentication (ssh keys) are centrally managed and distributed.  Host
admins should not be allowed to do this.</li>
<li>mirroring setup -- who's the master and who're the slaves for any repo</li>
<li>allowing redirected pushes from slaves</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="mirroring_complex_example_overview_of_setup_"></a></p>

<h2>overview of setup</h2>

<p>We will use p1 as the product, with sam as the master and frodo as a slave.
Assume equivalent text/code for other product/master/slave combos.</p>

<p>This setup imposes the condition that all repos should be under some directory
name; either a product name or, for local repos, a hostname.  In our example,
these directory names would be p1 or sam on the host sam, and frodo on the
host frodo.</p>

<p><a name="mirroring_complex_example_gitolite_feature_recap_"></a></p>

<h3>gitolite feature recap</h3>

<p>We use <a href="deleg.html" title="delegating access control responsibilities">delegation</a>, to ensure that admins for sam can only write
files whose names start with <code>master/sam/</code>.  The actual files they will write
are <code>master/sam/p1.conf</code> etc., one for each product that is mastered on their
server.</p>

<p>We use <a href="deleg.html#subconf" title="the subconf command">subconf</a>.  When you say <code>subconf "path/to/foo.conf</code>, then within
that file (and anything included from it), access can only be defined for
repos that regex-match one of the elements of <code>@foo</code>.</p>

<p><a name="mirroring_complex_example_pre_requisites_"></a></p>

<h2>pre-requisites</h2>

<p>First, install mirroring on all servers according to the main mirroring
document.  Set it up so that the gitolite-admin repo is mastered at one server
and everyone else slaves it.</p>

<p>Also, after (or during) the normal mirroring install, edit <code>~/.gitolite.rc</code> on
all servers and set <code>$GL_WILDREPOS</code> to 1 (from its default of 0).</p>

<p><a name="mirroring_complex_example_quick_setup_"></a></p>

<h2>quick setup</h2>

<ul>
<li>edit your <code>gitolite.conf</code> file as given in step 1 below
<ul>
<li>ignore all the comments, even the ones that tell you to do something :-)</li>
<li>change only the names of the admin users, and the names of the servers
in the config lines.  Everything else stays the same</li>
</ul></li>
<li>now copy <code>mirror-conf-helper</code> from the contrib directory to your home or
some easy to type place, and run it to setup your hosts, products, and slaves</li>
</ul>

<p>A typical sequence with that script is:</p>

<pre><code># cd to your gitolite-admin clone

# create a new host
~/mirror-conf-helper newhost sam sam-admin

# create the actual repository and access rules.  This is done by the host
# admin for the host on which it is mastered (or you can do it yourself).
# See step 3 below for details.
mkdir -p conf/master/sam
vim      conf/master/sam/p1.conf
    # now add in some "repo p1/..." and "RW ..." lines for the repos in
    # product p1 and save

# add product p1 to the list of repos sam is allowed to control
~/mirror-conf-helper newprod sam p1

# add a slave
~/mirror-conf-helper newslave sam p1 frodo
</code></pre>

<p>You can then treat the detailed steps described below as extra information or
"background reading" ;-)</p>

<p><a name="mirroring_complex_example_next_steps_"></a></p>

<h2>next steps</h2>

<p>Once you've done the initial setup, here's what ongoing additions will
require.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>any new repos that are created for the same <em>product</em> require only step 3</p></li>
<li><p>a new <em>product</em> will require steps A1, 3, 4 and 5</p></li>
<li><p>a new <em>host</em> will require additions in all the steps, including adding the
hostname in the slaves list for the admin repo (this is in the main
gitolite.conf file)</p></li>
</ul>
