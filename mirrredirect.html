<h3>redirecting pushes</h3>

<p><strong>Please read carefully; there are security implications if you enable this
for mirrors NOT under your control</strong>.</p>

<p>When a user pushes to a non-native repo, it is possible to transparently
redirect the push to the correct master server.  This is a very neat feature,
because now all your users just use one URL (the mirror nearest to them).
They don't need to know where the actual master is, and more importantly, if
you and the other admins change it, they don't need to know it changed!</p>

<p>The <code>gitolite.mirror.redirectOK</code> config variable decides where this
redirection is OK.  If it is set to 'true', any valid 'slave' can redirect an
incoming non-native push from a developer.  Otherwise, it contains a list of
slaves that are permitted to redirect pushes (this might happen if you don't
trust some of your slaves enough to accept a redirected push from them).</p>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: like <code>gitolite.mirror.slaves</code>, this key also should have only
hosts, no keys, in it.</p>

<p>This check needs to pass on both the master and slave servers; both have a say
in deciding if this is allowed.  (The master may have real reasons not to
allow this; see below.  I cannot think of any real reason for the <em>slave</em> to
disable this, but it's there in case some admin doesn't like it).</p>

<p>There are some potential issues that you MUST consider before enabling this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(security) If the slave and master server are so different or autonomous
that a user, say "alice", on the slave is not guaranteed to be the same
one as "alice" on the master, then the master admin should NOT enable this
feature.</p>

<p>This is because, in this scheme, authentication happens on the slave, but
authorisation is on the master.  The slave-authenticated userid (alice) is
passed to the master.</p>

<p>(If you know ssh well enough, you know that the ssh authentication has
already happened, so all we can do is ensure authorisation happens with
whatever username we know so far).</p></li>
<li><p>If your slave is out of sync with the master for whatever reason, then the
user will get confusing results.  A <code>git fetch</code> may say everything is
upto-date but the push fails saying it is not a fast-forward push.  (Of
course there's a way to fix this; see the "commands to (re-)sync mirrors"
section above).</p></li>
<li><p>We cannot redirect non-git commands like ADC, setperms, etc because we
don't really have a way of knowing what repo he's talking about (different
commands have different syntaxes, some have more than one reponame...).
Any user who needs to do that should access the end server directly.  It
should be easy enough to write an ADC to do the forwarding, in case the
slave server is the only one that can reach the real master due to network
or firewall setup.</p>

<p>Ideally, I recommend that ad hoc repos not be mirrored at all.  Keep
mirroring for "blessed" repos only.</p></li>
</ul>
