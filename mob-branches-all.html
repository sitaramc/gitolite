<h1>mob branches in gitolite</h1>

<p>WARNING: This is hairy stuff.  But what's life without a little danger?</p>

<p>WARNING 2: girocco does mob branches quite differently; the controls on what a
mob branch can do are much more fundamental.  Here we just trick gitolite into
accepting anonymous ssh connections and pretending they're from a mythical
user called "mob".  <strong>This means all the access control is -- as you might
expect -- in the gitolite.conf file, so make sure you don't give the <code>mob</code>
user too many rights!</strong></p>

<p>(tested on Fedora 14; assumes your gitolite server userid is "gitolite" and
install was "non-root" method; adjust according to your environment.  If you
need more than this, you should not be enabling mob branches anyway ;-)</p>

<p>[hah!  Easy way out of being badgered with questions!]</p>

<ul>
<li><p>create a file called <code>/tmp/mobshell</code> (put it somewhere more permanent if
you wish).  This file should be <code>chmod +x</code> and contain</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
shift
export SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND
SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND="$*"

/home/gitolite/bin/gl-auth-command mob
    # see one of the lines in ~gitolite/.ssh/authorized_keys for the
    # precise location of the gl-auth-command script
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>create a user called mob.  Give it the same UID number and <code>$HOME</code> as your
gitolite server userid, and set the login shell to be the script you just
created.  Also delete the password.</p>

<pre><code>id -u gitolite
# returns 503 or something...
useradd -d /home/gitolite -s /tmp/mobshell -u 503 -o mob
passwd -d mob
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>make sure you have a recent enough sshd and put these lines at the bottom,
then restart sshd</p>

<pre><code>    Match user mob
        PermitEmptyPasswords yes
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>That's it.  Now you can add stuff to your gitolite.conf file.  Here's some
examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This allows the mob user to do anything to the "mob" branch:</p>

<pre><code>repo foo
    RW+         =   alice bob
    R           =   eve
    RW+ mob$    =   mob
    # only the mob branch, nothing more
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>This is the same, except it can be any branch under "mob/" so you get some
flexibility:</p>

<pre><code>    RW+ mob/    =   mob
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Girocco allows pushing to the mob branch only if it already exists (that
is, the mob user cannot <em>create</em> the mob branch, but if it already exists
he can push to it).  Here's how you'd do that in gitolite:</p>

<pre><code>repo foo
    RW+C        =   alice bob
    R           =   eve
    RW+ mob$    =   mob
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>This gives <em>every</em> repo a mob branch (be careful!)</p>

<pre><code>repo @all
    RW+ mob$    =   mob
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>How do mob users access it?  The URLs just look like: <code>mob@server:repo</code>
instead of <code>gitolite@server:repo</code> That's it!</p>
