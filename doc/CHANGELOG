Major changes to gitolite, master branch only, most recent first, no dates but
the tags can help you position stuff approximately
[NYD = not yet documented due to lack of time...]

  - v1.5.1 -- tries to eliminate the need to run gl-setup on data version
    change, thus hopefully obsoleting the upgrade note for v1.5 (just below).

  - v1.5 -- IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTES below

    Upgrading to v1.5 from any version prior to v1.5 requires an extra step
    for people who installed gitolite using the "system install / user setup"
    method described in doc/0-INSTALL.mkd.  For such installations, after the
    administrator has upgraded gitolite system-wide, each "gitolite host" user
    must run `gl-setup` once (this time without any arguments).

  - "deny" rules should now work even in "big-config" due to previous change
  - proper rule sequencing (required major format change)

  - allow usergroup info to be passed in from outside, say via LDAP; see
    doc/big-config.mkd for details
  - (new) big-config is now part of mainline (old one had bitrotted); see
    doc/big-config.mkd for details

  - gl-system-install: help people simulate an RPM/DEB install by just running
    that commmand with appropriate arguments; see doc/0-INSTALL.mkd

  - admin-defined commands; see doc/admin-defined-commands.mkd

  - v1.4.2 (prep for major refactor on rights queries
  - v1.4.1 (security fix)

  - REFUSE TO RUN ON SERVER GIT < 1.6.2 (do NOT upgrade gitolite to or beyond
    this point if you are unable to upgrade git itself to at least 1.6.2)

  - "D" must be combined with RW or RW+ (warning: minor backward compat breakage)

  - v1.4

  - recurse through keydir for pubkeys
  - bypass update hook if GL_BYPASS_UPDATE_HOOK is available in ENV
  - new server-side program "gl-tool", subcommand "shell-add"
  - new "D" permission (makes RW+ no longer imply "D" if used)
  - @all for repos is now a true @all
  - allow setperms to specify @all
  - post-update hook and gl-setup should be dash compat now
  - workaround for a Data::Dumper crash; see 412a691
  - both hooks chain to "<hookname>.secondary" now
