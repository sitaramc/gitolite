## #dev-status g3 development status

Not yet done (will be tackled in this order unless someone asks):

  * mechanism for ADCs using unchecked arguments -- this is not just a matter
    of writing it; I have to think about *how* it will be done.  (AFAIK the
    only tool affected is git-annexe; if there are more let me know)

Help needed:

  * I'd like distro packagers to play with it and help with migration advice
    for distro-upgrades
  * rsync
  * git-annexe support (but this has a pre-requisite in the previous list)

Won't be done unless someone asks (saw no evidence that anyone used them in g2
anyway!):

  * mob branches
  * password access
  * some of the more arcane rc variables!
  * specific ADCs -- there are too many for me to bother without applying
    Pareto somewhere, so I choose to not do any and wait for people to ask :-)

Done:

  * core code
  * test suite
  * mirroring
  * documentation
  * migration documentation
  * distro packaging instructions
  * migration advice for common cases
  * smart http
  * svnserve
  * htpasswd
