<h1><strong>Why v2?</strong></h1>

<p>I went onto <code>#perl</code> to ask some question about setpriority() and got yelled at
for writing "horrible code".  And that was one of the kinder comments; my
rather fragile ego is trying to forget the rest ;-)</p>

<p>They also gave me a link to a PDF book, "Modern Perl" by 'chromatic'.  Nice
book; one of the first things you learn from it is that you should not go to
<code>#perl</code> for general help.</p>

<p>Anyway, the summary of the collective angst of <code>#perl</code> (well 2 people anyway)
was: use Getopt::Long, FindBin, 'use lib', a library for HTTP stuff, stop
prefixing subs with '&amp;', and get rid of the huge number of 'our' declarations.</p>

<p>That last item is the only one I totally agree with, because it was on my long
term todo list anyway.  And 'use lib' sorta goes with it, so that's fine too.
And as soon as I found that vim colors the sub names differently if you take
out the '&amp;' I decided I'd do that too :-) [But honestly, if <code>&amp;sub</code> is so bad
shouldn't "man perlsub" at least say something negative about it, other than
"disables prototype checking", which doesn't matter here since I'm not using
prototypes?]</p>

<p>As for the rest, FindBin brings in a good 1000+ lines for something that I do
in a line or two (since I don't care about all the pathological edge cases).
Getopt::Long is 2649 lines to replace the code below  [note that there <em>is</em>
only one possible option to this command, and it is <em>never</em> run manually
either, so I don't need any fancy features]:</p>

<pre><code>my $shell_allowed = 0;
if (@ARGV and $ARGV[0] eq '-s') {
    $shell_allowed = 1;
    shift;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Apparently TMTOWTDI has given way to TOOWTDI.</p>

<p>Anyway, I spent a few hours refactoring it.  And I do thank them for pushing
me to stop being lazy on the "our" business.</p>
