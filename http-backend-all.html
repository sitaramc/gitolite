<h1>how to setup gitolite to use smart http mode</h1>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: "smart http" refers to the feature that came with git 1.6.6, late
2009 or so.  The base documentation for this is <code>man git-http-backend</code>.  Do
<strong>NOT</strong> read <code>Documentation/howto/setup-git-server-over-http.txt</code> and think
that is the same or even relevant -- that is from 2006 and is quite different
(and arguably obsolete).</p>

<p><a name="http_backend_WARNINGS_plus_stuff_I_need_help_with_"></a></p>

<h2>WARNINGS, plus stuff I need help with</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I have NOT converted the test suite to use this mode.  Volunteers to
convert it to http access are welcome :-)</p></li>
<li><p>I have no idea how to handle the password issue other than creating a
<code>~/.netrc</code> file and making it <code>chmod 600</code>.  Anyway, http based access is
inherently less secure than pubkeys so not much point worrying about it.</p></li>
<li><p>I have not tested any of the ancillary standalone programs (like
gl-admin-push) in this mode.  They're most likely going to crash and burn
because <code>$HOME</code> is not defined or in the wrong place; manually set
<code>HOME=$GITOLITE_HTTP_HOME</code> and hope for the best.  Luckily most of them
have to do with sshkeys so this may not matter.  YMMV.</p></li>
<li><p>tested on stock Fedora 14; if you test on other environments please let me
know how it worked out and if we need to adjust this document</p></li>
<li><p>tested https with dummy certs and <code>GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY</code>; no reason why it
shouldn't work on a proper setup with everything in place</p></li>
<li><p>have not tried making repos available to both ssh <em>and</em> http mode clients;
(I'd guess it ought to work fine if the "apache" user was made login-able
and given a proper $HOME and <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> and all that).  If
anyone has the energy to try that please let me know how that went.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="http_backend_additional_requirements_"></a></p>

<h2>additional requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>requires <code>GIT_PROJECT_ROOT</code> (see "man git-http-backend" for what this is)
set explicitly (i.e., it is no longer optional).  Please set it to some
place outside apache's <code>DOCUMENT_ROOT</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="http_backend_detailed_instructions_"></a></p>

<h2>detailed instructions</h2>

<p>I assume you've installed apache 2.x and git on the server.</p>

<p>I assume your httpd runs under the "apache" userid; adjust instructions below
if it does not.  Similarly for "/var/www" and other file names/locations.</p>

<p>I assume you have read the "<a href="install.html#insttrouble" title="install trouble?">please read this first</a>" section of the
main install document to get an idea of the general concepts and terminology
(just ignore anything that is specific to ssh).</p>

<p><a name="http_backend_install_gitolite_under_apache__"></a></p>

<h3>install gitolite under "apache"</h3>

<p>Follow the "non-root" method, but since you can't even "su - apache", make the
following variations when doing this as root:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>cd ~apache</code> first; this is <code>/var/www</code> on Fedora 14</p></li>
<li><p>do this in the shell</p>

<pre><code>mkdir gitolite-home
export GITOLITE_HTTP_HOME
GITOLITE_HTTP_HOME=/var/www/gitolite-home
PATH=$PATH:$GITOLITE_HTTP_HOME/bin
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>now run the following commands.  These are really the first 3 steps of the
"non-root" install (clone, mkdir, and gl-system-install), <strong>except</strong> you
substitute <code>GITOLITE_HTTP_HOME</code> in place of <code>HOME</code>.  Note that you do NOT
run the gl-setup step yet.</p>

<pre><code>cd gitolite-home
git clone /tmp/gitolite.git gitolite-source
    # or wherever your local clone is, or directly from git://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite

cd gitolite-source
GHH=$GITOLITE_HTTP_HOME     # just for convenience in next 2 commands
mkdir -p              $GHH/bin $GHH/share/gitolite/conf $GHH/share/gitolite/hooks
src/gl-system-install $GHH/bin $GHH/share/gitolite/conf $GHH/share/gitolite/hooks
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>after the gl-system-install step, add these to the <strong>top</strong> of
/var/www/gitolite-home/share/gitolite/conf/example.gitolite.rc</p>

<pre><code>$ENV{GIT_HTTP_BACKEND} = "/usr/libexec/git-core/git-http-backend";
    # or wherever you have that file; note: NO trailing slash
$ENV{PATH} .= ":$ENV{GITOLITE_HTTP_HOME}/bin";
    # note the ".=" here, not "="
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>run gl-setup with the name of your admin user</p>

<pre><code>gl-setup sitaram
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>IMPORTANT: fix up ownerships</p>

<pre><code>chown -R apache.apache $GITOLITE_HTTP_HOME
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="http_backend_setup_apache_"></a></p>

<h3>setup apache</h3>

<p>You will need to setup certain values in the httpd conf, as given in <code>man
git-http-backend</code>.  You can put all them into, for instance,
<code>/etc/httpd/conf.d/gitolite.conf</code> and apache [at least on Fedora 14] will pick
it up.  These are the values to use; note that these are somewhat different
from those in the manpage cited above, plus we have one extra variable:</p>

<pre><code>SetEnv GIT_PROJECT_ROOT /var/www/gitolite-home/repositories
SetEnv GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL
    # please see notes below on ssh+http access
ScriptAlias /git/ /var/www/gitolite-home/bin/gl-auth-command/
    # note trailing slash

SetEnv GITOLITE_HTTP_HOME /var/www/gitolite-home

&lt;Location /git&gt;
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Private Git Access"
    Require valid-user
    AuthUserFile /path/to/some/passwdfile
&lt;/Location&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now create/update the password file in <code>/path/to/some/passwdfile</code> using the
<code>htpasswd</code> command, and you're all done for the setup!</p>

<p><a name="http_backend_usage_"></a></p>

<h2>usage</h2>

<p>Git URLs look like <code>http://user:password@server/git/reponame.git</code>.</p>

<p>The custom commands, like "info", "expand" should be handled as follows.  The
command name will come just after the <code>/git/</code>, followed by a <code>?</code>, followed by
the arguments, with <code>+</code> representing a space.  Here are some examples:</p>

<pre><code># ssh git@server info
curl http://user:password@server/git/info
# ssh git@server info repopatt
curl http://user:password@server/git/info?repopatt
# ssh git@server info repopatt user1 user2
curl http://user:password@server/git/info?repopatt+user1+user2
</code></pre>

<p>It gets even more interesting for the <code>setperms</code> command, which expects STDIN.
I didn't want to get too much into the code here, so I found that the
following works and I'm leaving it at that:</p>

<pre><code>(echo R user1 user2; echo RW user3 user4) |
    curl --data-binary @- http://user:password@server/git/setperms?reponame.git
</code></pre>

<p>With a few nice shell aliases, you won't even notice the horrible convolutions
here ;-)</p>

<p><a name="http_backend_allowing_anonymous_access_"></a></p>

<h2>allowing anonymous access</h2>

<p>Like <a href="mob.html" title="mob branches in gitolite">mob branches</a> with ssh, you can allow completely
<strong>un</strong>-authenticated users to still have some rights specified in gitolite.
Briefly, here's how:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>specify a ScriptAlias in apache config for unauthenticated access also.  I
prefer something like</p>

<pre><code>ScriptAlias /gitmob/ /var/www/gitolite-home/bin/gl-auth-command/
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>set <code>$GL_HTTP_ANON_USER</code> to some name, like 'mob' or 'anon' in the rc file</p></li>
<li><p>give rights to this user ('mob' or 'anon' or whatever you used) in the
gitolite config file and push the change</p></li>
</ul>

<p>URLs (in this example) will then look like <code>http://server/gitmob/reponame.git</code>
-- we lose the userid:passwd part and change 'git' to 'gitmob'.</p>

<p><a name="http_backend_ssh_http_access_and_the_GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL_variable_"></a></p>

<h2>ssh + http access and the <code>GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL</code> variable</h2>

<p>This document only talks about setting up access to a set of git repositories
purely via smart http.  The <code>GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL</code> variable must be set for
such environments.</p>

<p>However, it is possible to allow both ssh as well as http access, perhaps
using suexec to make the CGI run under the 'git' user [detailed documentation
patches welcome!]  For those environments, this variable is not mandatory.</p>

<p>If you omit that variable, you can decide which repo is accessible via http by
setting <code>R = daemon</code> just for those repos.</p>

<p>Please note that there is no way to use "deny" rules for <em>read</em> access.  Do
not try:</p>

<pre><code>    repo gitolite-admin
        -   =   daemon

    repo @all
        R   =   daemon
</code></pre>

<p>to achieve the (possibly common) need for disallowing http access to the admin
repo.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
