<h2>storing usergroup information outside gitolite (like in LDAP)</h2>

<p>[Please NOTE: this is all about <em>user</em> groups, not <em>repo</em> groups]</p>

<p>[WARNING: the earlier method of doing this has been discontinued; please see
the commit message for details]</p>

<p>Gitolite now allows usergroup information to be stored outside its own config
file.  We'll see "why" first, then the "how".</p>

<p><a name="ldapwhy_"></a></p>

<h3>why</h3>

<p>Large sites often have LDAP servers that already contain user and group
information, including group membership details.  Such sites may prefer that
gitolite just pick up that info instead of having to redundantly put it in
gitolite's config file.</p>

<p>Consider this example config for one repo:</p>

<pre><code>repo foo
    RW+ =   @lead_devs
    RW  =   @devs
    R   =   @interns
</code></pre>

<p>Normally, you would also need to specify:</p>

<pre><code>@lead_devs  =   dilbert alice
@devs       =   wally
@interns    =   ashok
</code></pre>

<p>However, if the corporate LDAP server already tags these people correctly, and
if there is some way of getting that information out <strong>at run time</strong>, that
would be cool.</p>

<p><a name="ldaphow_"></a></p>

<h3>how</h3>

<p>All you need is a script that, given a username, queries your LDAP or similar
server, and returns a space-separated list of all the groups she is a member
of.  If an invalid user name is sent in, or the user is valid but is not part
of any groups, it should print nothing.</p>

<p>This script will probably be specific to your site.  (See contrib/ldap for some
example scripts that were contributed by the Nokia MeeGo team.)</p>

<p>Then set the <code>$GL_GET_MEMBERSHIPS_PGM</code> variable in the rc file to the full
path of this program, set <code>$GL_BIG_CONFIG</code> to 1, and that will be that.</p>
