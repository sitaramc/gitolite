Oh I forgot to add that most people won't see this error...

In normal usage, you should only see this error if you have include files in
your config setup (very few people do) *and* you want to add a new hook on the
server (for which the only way is to run gl-setup).

Even if you cannot upgrade, the workaround for this bug is, after gl-setup
runs (complaining about included files not found), you immediately make a
dummy commit to your gitolite-admin repo and push -- that'll fix it up again.
