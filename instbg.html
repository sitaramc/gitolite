<h3>helpful background information</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>gitolite runs as a single (real) user on a server, and is invoked via ssh.
Traditionally, this "hosting user" is "git", and thus all git URLs start
with <code>ssh://git@server</code> (or the equivalent shorter form <code>git@server:</code>).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>RPM/DEB create and use "gitolite" as the hosting user</p></li>
<li><p>there is <em>usually</em> only one hosting user per server (machine), but
gitolite makes it trivial to have as many as you want.  In fact, every
user on the server is a potential hosting user.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>using this single user and sshd (or httpd) authentication, gitolite allows
you to create any number of "virtual" users.  Virtual user names only mean
something to gitolite, and they need not be the same as any real userid on
the server or any of the clients accessing it.</p>

<ul>
<li>the first such virtual user is the "admin user", created during the
install sequence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>gitolite depends <strong>heavily</strong> on ssh pubkey (passwordless) access.  Do not
assume you know all about ssh -- most people <strong>don't</strong>.  If in doubt, use
a dedicated userid on both client and server for installation and
administration of gitolite.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, ssh problems in gitolite don't always look like ssh
problems.  See the <a href="sts.html" title="ssh troubleshooting">ssh troubleshooting</a> document for help.</p></li>
<li><p>gitolite <strong>does NOT</strong> like it when people with shell access to the server
fiddle with files and directories it controls.</p>

<p>Apparently this was not obvious to some people.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It is possible to have the server and the client be the same machine, and even
the admin user be also the hosting user, (i.e., <code>sitaram@server</code> can install
and administer a gitolite setup running under <code>sitaram@server</code>, a situation
that is common with some hosting services).  It's actually fairly easy and
<strong>safe</strong> to do, <strong>as long as you have password access to the server</strong> for
emergency use.  However, I will not be documenting it because (a) if you know
ssh you'll know how to extrapolate my instructions to do this and (b) if you
don't know ssh it'll be a nightmare to support you.</p>
