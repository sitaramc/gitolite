<h2>using hooks</h2>

<p><a name="customhooks"></a></p>

<h3>custom hooks</h3>

<p>You can supply your own, custom, hook scripts if you wish.  Install gitolite
as usual, then:</p>

<ul>
<li>go to ~/.gitolite/hooks/common on the server and put your new hook there</li>
<li>now run "gl-setup" again</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use this procedure to install new hooks as well as to update hooks
that you had previously installed.</p>

<p><font color="red"><strong>IMPORTANT WARNINGS</strong></font></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <code>update</code> hook in <code>hooks/common</code> is what implements all the
branch-level permissions in gitolite.  If you fiddle with the hooks
directory, please make sure you do not mess with this file accidentally,
or all your fancy per-branch permissions will stop working.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not under any conditions put anything in <code>hooks/gitolite-admin</code> --
nothing in gitolite requires you to do anything here.  Leave it alone!</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="hookchaining"></a></p>

<h3>hook chaining</h3>

<p>Sometimes you need to use git hooks for your own purposes (site-local
validations, CI integration, email notifications, or the ever popular "live
website update"!).  However, the hooks you want to use may already be in use
by gitolite.</p>

<p>This section will tell you what to do in such cases.  First, let's list the
hooks that gitolite uses:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <code>update</code> hook is used in all repos and is critical to gitolite's
access control!</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>post-receive</code> hook is used in all repos but only if mirroring has
been enabled.  Shipped as <code>post-receive.mirrorpush</code>, it is renamed to
'post-receive' and installed as part of the mirroring setup.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>post-update</code> hook is used in the <code>gitolite-admin</code> repo only, to
"compile" the configuration and so on.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To run your own 'update' hook, just put it in a file called <code>update.secondary</code>
and install it as a hook.  Gitolite's update hook will automatically chain to
it, taking care to pass it the same 3 arguments the original update hook
received from git.</p>

<p><font color="gray"></p>

  <p>Also see the document on <a href="vref.html" title="virtual refs">virtual refs</a> for a way to add additional
  checks that you might need.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></font></p>

<p>For <code>post-receive</code>, (if using mirroring) do the opposite.  You're normally
expected to rename the shipped 'post-receive.mirrorpush' to 'post-receive',
but don't do this.  Instead, simply run <code>hooks/post-receive.mirrorpush</code> at the
end of <em>your</em> hook code.  Do not worry about replicating STDIN (the documented
way in which a post-receive hook receives its input) because the mirroring
code does not use it.</p>

<p>To run your own <code>post-update</code> hook on normal repos, just install a hook called
'post-update' the usual way.  It'll be installed on all normal repos but not
on the special gitolite-admin repo.  If you need that for the gitolite-admin
repo, you'll have to call it <code>post-update.secondary</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, these names ('update.secondary' and 'post-update.secondary') are
merely the defaults.  You can change them to anything you want; look in
conf/example.gitolite.rc for details.</p>

<p><a name="admin_environment_variables_available_to_hooks_"></a></p>

<h3>environment variables available to hooks</h3>

<p>The following environment variables are set, and may be useful for any custom
processing you wish to do in your hook code:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>GL_USER</code> -- the user doing the push</li>
<li><code>GL_REPO</code> -- the reponame</li>
<li><code>GL_REPO_BASE_ABS</code> -- the absolute base path where all the repos are kept</li>
</ul>

<p>The following variables are also set, but are generally less useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>GL_BINDIR</code> -- where all the binaries live</li>
<li><code>GL_ADMINDIR</code> -- common directory for many gitolite things</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="admin_gl_post_init_hook_"></a></p>

<h3>"gl-post-init" hook</h3>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to do something whenever a new repo is created.  If
you need this functionality, just supply a hook called "gl-post-init" with
whatever code you want in it.</p>

<p><a name="pre-git"></a></p>

<h3>"gl-pre-git" hook</h3>

<p>Although git has lots of nice hooks you can tap into, they all run only on a
push.  There's nothing that runs on a fetch or a clone, and there's no way to
run something <em>before</em> git-receive-pack or git-upload-pack, (as the case may
be) are invoked.</p>

<p>That's what the <code>gl-pre-git</code> hook is for.  If an executable hook called
<code>gl-pre-git</code> is present, it will be invoked with the current directory set to
<code>repo.git</code>, and with a single argument which will be either <code>R</code> or <code>W</code>
depending on what the client is trying to do.  The environment variables
<code>GL_USER</code> and <code>GL_REPO</code> are available.  STDOUT will be forced to STDERR before
it is called, to avoid confusing the client.</p>

<p>If the code returns anything other than 0, gitolite will terminate the
operation (i.e., not run git at all), just like many git hooks do, so make
sure you end with <code>exit 0</code> or equivalent.</p>
