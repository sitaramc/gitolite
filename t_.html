<h1>notes on the testing setup</h1>

<p><strong>WARNING: PLEASE use a dedicated user for doing this</strong>.  Various files and
directories get overwritten and it's much simpler this way.</p>

<p><a name="README_t_terminology_"></a></p>

<h2>terminology</h2>

<h2>notes and background</h2>

<p>All testing is done on one <strong>brand new</strong> userid.  We use ssh host alias tricks
to simulate multiple gitolite users within this, so <code>ssh gitolite info</code> gets
you different results than <code>ssh u1 info</code>.</p>

<p>The test suite is mainly meant for testing <strong>the core (access control)
functionality</strong>.  It doesn't test anything else, like say the install or
upgrade operations.  Other big features NOT covered by the test suite are
mirroring, smart http, and password-based access.</p>

<p>Note that the test driver has evolved as new scripts were added; you will see
that older scripts are a little less sophisticated.</p>

<h2>playing with gitolite</h2>

<p>(Please heed the warning at the top of this document and use a dedicated user
for this).</p>

<p>Playing with gitolite is easy.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create a userid (doesn't matter what it's called; we'll pretend it's
"gl-test" in this document).</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure sshd allows incoming ssh to this userid at least from localhost.
(Out of scope for this document: sshd config, 'AllowUsers', etc...)</p></li>
<li><p>Now log in as this user (doesn't matter how), and run the following
commands:</p>

<pre><code>cd $HOME        # if not already in $HOME
git clone git://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite
gitolite/t/install
</code></pre>

<p>This installs the "testbed" in the userid you chose.  No other user is
affected in any way.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is what you get when you do this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A gitolite user called "tester", tied to an ssh host alias called
"gitolite".  This user has RW+ rights to the admin repo; running <code>ssh
gitolite info</code> should get you the expected results.</p></li>
<li><p>Six gitolite users called "u1" through "u6", all done through ssh host
aliases.  Running <code>ssh u1 info</code> etc. should show you only the "testing"
repo accessible to them.</p></li>
<li><p>A clone of the admin repo in <code>~/gitolite-admin</code>, created by <code>git clone
gitolite:gitolite-admin</code>.  If you <code>cd ~/gitolite-admin</code>, you will see the
keys for the users mentioned above (tester, u1, ..., u6).</p></li>
<li><p>The rest of a gitolite installation, such as the rc file in <code>~/.gitolite.rc</code> etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Don't forget that the client and the server are all on the same user on the
same machine.</p>

<p>And don't forget, too, that we are simulating 7 gitolite users using ssh keys!
(How?  Maybe <code>~/.ssh/config</code> will give you a hint).  You can now use those 7
users in any way you please in the config file and test out different user's
access simply using a different URL.  For example, <code>git clone u1:testing</code> and
<code>git clone u2:testing</code> may give you different results depending on what rights
you gave users "u1" and "u2" in your config.</p>

<h2>testing gitolite</h2>

<p>First, do what the "playing with gitolite" section says.  That is a
pre-requisite.</p>

<p>Once that is done, run this command (still in <code>$HOME</code> of the gl-test userid):</p>

<pre><code>prove gitolite/t/test-driver.sh
</code></pre>

<p>(note: to make it work easier with prove, I ended up making the "subtest"
numbers be the actual test numbers, making it look like I have over 2000
tests, when in reality I have about 600)</p>
