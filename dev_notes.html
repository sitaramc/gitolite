<h1>developer/patch maintainer notes</h1>

<p><a name="developer_notes_general_stuff_"></a></p>

<h2>general stuff</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>all scripts and libraries must be in the same directory.  However, RPM/DEB
packagers can put the libraries where they want, as long as they can be
found in perl's default <code>@INC</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>gl-auth-command <strong>requires</strong> an actual <code>~/.gitolite.rc</code> (except if your
initials are "JK" or "DG", in which case <code>/etc/gitolite/gitolite.rc</code> also
works!)  It knows how to look around and set env vars etc correctly</p></li>
<li><p>all programs except gl-auth-command <strong>require</strong> the environment variables
<code>GL_RC</code> and <code>GL_BINDIR</code> set properly.  Your best bet is to run them <em>via</em>
gl-auth-command, like so:</p>

<pre><code>path/to/gl-auth-command -e other_program other_program_arguments
</code></pre>

<p>In any case none of these programs are meant to be run manually -- pretty
much all of them are run via gl-auth-command or from something that was
forked from it so the variables <em>will</em> exist during normal operation.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="developer_notes_the_rc_file_"></a></p>

<h2>the rc file</h2>

<p>The 'rc' file has one major change from v1: any new values in the rc file need
to be added to the @EXPORT list in <code>src/gitolite_rc.pm</code>.</p>

<p><a name="developer_notes_modules_"></a></p>

<h2>modules</h2>

<p>There are 3 "modules" (<code>gitolite_rc</code>, <code>gitolite_env</code>, and <code>gitolite</code> itself).
Their purposes should be fairly obvious.</p>

<p><a name="developer_notes_that_bindir_thing_"></a></p>

<h2>that 'bindir' thing</h2>

<p>The importance of <code>GL_BINDIR</code> is that the command= argument in
<code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> must be a full path, ideally, and the compile script
gets this from <code>GL_BINDIR</code>.</p>

<p><a name="developer_notes_from_perl_"></a></p>

<h3>from perl</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>for frequently run perl programs, I prefer my method</p>

<ul>
<li>gl-auth-command -- this is invoked with a full path</li>
<li>gl-mirror-shell -- same as above</li>
<li>gl-time -- same as above</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>"their" ideal is "FindBin".  I will use it only on manually or
infrequently run programs</p>

<ul>
<li>gl-setup-authkeys (external shim to compile keys separately from PTA)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="developer_notes_from_shell_"></a></p>

<h3>from shell</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>a perl program called gl-query-rc finds its own BINDIR (using my perl
method, not FindBin).  This is suitable for calling from shell scripts
as <code>${0%/*}/gl-query-rc GL_BINDIR</code></p>

<ul>
<li>gl-setup</li>
<li>gl-tool</li>
<li>gl-mirror-push</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="developer_notes_OUTLIER__"></a></p>

<h3>OUTLIER!</h3>

<ul>
<li>gl-admin-push is an outlier.  For some silly reason I have the notion that
even if it runs from /tmp it should get the right values, so it is the
only one that interrogates <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> to get the actual
BINDIR in use!</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="developer_notes_special_types_of_setups_"></a></p>

<h2>special types of setups</h2>

<p><a name="developer_notes_Fedora_"></a></p>

<h3>Fedora</h3>

<p>Fedora has a very special setup, as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>each user has his own userid and login</li>
<li>his/her ~/.ssh/authkeys file (containing only his/her key) has a
"command=" clause invoking gl-auth-command</li>
<li><p>trusted users have "gl-auth-command -s" meaning they can get a shell if
they want to</p></li>
<li><p>actual git repos are under "git" (or some such), and include the chmod g+s
(git init --shared) unix perms tricks for shared access.  (<font
color="gray">Starting with git 1.7.something, you would also need to
explicitly delete the new receive.denyNonFastForwards setting that git
seems to default to when you use --shared</font>).</p></li>
<li><p>but since they're coming through gl-auth, branch-level acls are in effect</p></li>
<li><p>the gitolite config file is generated from some database and compiled (all
via cron)</p></li>
<li><p>the keydir/ is empty; in fact they probably don't use the admin repo at
all, AFAIK</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The most important implication of this setup is that <strong>the RC file is no
longer is <code>$HOME</code> of the 'git' user</strong>.  They keep it in
<code>/etc/gitolite/gitolite.rc</code>.  This means that a properly setup rc file must
already be present in <code>/etc/gitolite/gitolite.rc</code> before doing any such
installs.</p>

<p>There are also some other "impedance mismatches" that may show up.  For
example, the gl-setup triggered by detecting a change in <code>$data_version</code>
following an RPM update once caused problems.  This auto-update is designed to
run on the next "hit" of any kind (which arguably makes things very easy in
normal installations), but in Fedora's case it also means it runs <em>as that
user</em>.  Who may not have "write" access to <code>$GL_ADMINDIR</code>!  So the compile
fails, and you now have new code trying to work with old format data.</p>

<p>The solution is to explicitly run a compile, from a properly privileged
userid, as soon as you do an RPM upgrade.</p>
