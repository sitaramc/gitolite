# example conf file for gitosis-lite

# overall syntax:
#     - everything in this is space-separated; no commas, semicolons, etc
#     - comments in the normal shell-ish style; no surprises there
#     - there are no continuation lines of any kind

# objectives, over and above gitosis:
#     - simpler syntax
#     - no gitweb/daemon control
#     - allows ff/non-ff control
#     - allows branch level control

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# USERS and GROUPS

# syntax:
#   @groupname = username [...]

# usernames and groupnames should be as simple as possible; there's no
# explicit list of allowed characters for now but that's a TODO item.

# too many users in one group?  just add more such lines
# (they accumulate, like squid ACLs)

@cust_A = cust1 cust2
@cust_A = cust99
@interns = indy james
@staff = me alice

# you can nest groups, but not recursively of course!
@staff = bob @interns
@secret_staff = bruce whitfield martin

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# REPOS, REFS, and PERMISSIONS

# syntax:
#   repo [one or more reponames]
#   (R|RW|RW+) [zero or more refnames] = [one or more users]

# notes:

#     - RW+ means non-ff push is allowed
#     - you can't write just "W" or "+"; it has to be R, or RW, or RW+

#     - if no ref name appears, the rule applies to all refs in that repo
#     - ref names are perl regex patterns
#         - prefixed by "refs/heads/" if it doesn't start with "refs/"
#           (i.e., tags have to be explicitly named as refs/tags/pattern)

#     - the list of users can inlude any group name defined earlier
#     - "@all" is a special, predefined, groupname

# anyone can play in the sandbox, including making non-fastforward commits
# (that's what the "+" means)
repo sandbox
    RW+     = @all

# my repo and alice's repo have the same memberships and access, so we just
# put them both in the same stanza
repo myrepo alicerepo
    RW+     = me  alice
    R       = bob  eve

# this repo is visible to customers from company A but they can't write to it
repo cust_A_repo
    R       = @cust_A
    RW      = @staff

# idea for the tags syntax shamelessly copied from git.git
# Documentation/howto/update-hook-example.txt :)
repo secret
    RW+ pu                  = bruce
    RW master next          = bruce
    RW refs/tags/v[0-9].*   = bruce
    RW refs/tags/           = @secret_staff
    RW tmp/.*               = @secret_staff
    R                       = @secret_staff
