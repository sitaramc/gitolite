Usage:  gitolite list-dangling-repos

List all existing repos that no one can access remotely any more.  They could
be normal repos that were taken out of "repo" statements in the conf file, or
wildcard repos whose matching "wild" pattern was taken out or changed so it no
longer matches.

# get the two lists we need.  %repos is the list of repos in "repo" statements
# in the conf file.  %phy_repos is the list of actual repos on disk.  Our job
# is to cull %phy_repos of all keys that have a matching key in %repos, where
# "matching" means "string equal" or "regex match".

my %phy_repos = map { chomp; $_ => 1 } `gitolite list-phy-repos`;

# Remove exact matches.  But for repo names like "gtk+", you could have
# collapsed this into the next step (the regex match).
