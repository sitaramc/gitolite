# === add-auth-keys ===

# part of the gitolite (GL) suite

# (1) - "compiles" ~/.ssh/authorized_keys from the list of pub-keys
# (2) - also "compiles" the user-friendly GL conf file into something easier
#       to parse.  We're doing this because both the gl-auth-command and the
#       (gl-)update hook need this, and it seems easier to do this than
#       replicate the parsing code in both those places.  As a bonus, it's
#       probably more efficient.
# (3) - finally does what I have resisted doing all along -- handle gitweb and
#       git-daemon access.  It won't *setup* gitweb/daemon for you -- you have
#       to that yourself.  What this does is make sure that "repo.git"
#       contains the file "git-daemon-export-ok" (for daemon case) and the
#       line "repo.git" exists in the "projects.list" file (for gitweb case).

# how run:      manual, by GL admin
# when:
#     - anytime a pubkey is added/deleted
#     - anytime gitolite.conf is changed
# input:
#     - GL_CONF (default: ~/.gitolite/gitolite.conf)
#     - GL_KEYDIR (default: ~/.gitolite/keydir)
# output:
#     - ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (dictated by sshd)
#     - GL_CONF_COMPILED (default: ~/.gitolite/gitolite.conf-compiled.pm)
# security:
#     - touches a very critical system file that manages the restrictions on
#       incoming users.  Be sure to audit AUTH_COMMAND and AUTH_OPTIONS (see
#       below) on any change to this script
#     - no security checks within program.  The GL admin runs this manually

# warnings:
#     - if the "start" line exists, but the "end" line does not, you lose the
#       rest of the existing authkey file.  In general, "don't do that (TM)",
#       but we do have a "vim -d" popping up so you can see the changes being
#       made, just in case...
