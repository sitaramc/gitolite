  * a proper INSTALL file with clear instructions for non-experts

  * make a proper test suite

  * `use Git` instead of run git commands: I don't run too many git commands
    in this and Git.pm just runs the same commands (per the documentation), so
    it's sorta moot right now, but it's worth trying

  * change the "rc" file to use "gitconfig" instead...

  * check user/group names with some suitable regex
